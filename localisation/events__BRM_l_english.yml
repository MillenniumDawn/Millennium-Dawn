 Burma_News.1.t:0 "A New Path for Myanmar?"
 Burma_News.1.d:0 "The military government today announced that the decades long process of drafting a new constitution has finally been completed. While the new constitution marks a liberalising shift in Myanmar’s politics, it nonetheless preserves the military’s continued role in government, such as by ensuring its possession of 25% of the seats in parliament. It remains to be seen whether this constitution will be a vehicle for democratisation or a tool for continued military domination."
