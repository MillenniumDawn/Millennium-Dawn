 BOL_ethnic_divide_decisions_desc: "\n\n\n\n\n\n£BOL_desctext_ethnic_divide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolivia is suffering from deep ethnic and racial divisions, between the Mestizo people, which are people of mixed European and Indigenous descent which mostly make up the majority in Eastern Bolivia, collectively known as the Media Luna and the Indigenous People of Bolivia which make up the majority in Western Bolivia. In recent years tensions have flared up, with many indigenous protests over issue like lack of rights and water access. It is important to keep the opinion of these groups at stable levels, otherwise we may get two different kinds of instability from both sides, Therefore we must tread carefully as one bad decision can lead to the fracturing of Bolivia as we know it.\n\n§RIf Indigenous Opinion falls below 15, Indigenous groups will demand the resignation of our government by means of mass protest, and if we do not comply to their demands the Indigenous People of Western Bolivia will revolt against the government.§!\n\n§YIf Mestizo opinion falls under 15, the historically influential and pro-mestizo [Nat_Autocracy_L] will demand the resignation of our government and the placement of a pro-mestizo interim government until early elections are held, but if we do not comply the Military will launch a coup and install a military regime in power.§!\n\nMestizo Opinion: [?BOL_mestizo_support]\n\nIndigenous Opinion: [?BOL_indigenous_support]"

##events
 bolivia_misc.1.t: "National Referendum On Gas"
 bolivia_misc.1.d: "The Bolivian government has called on a referendum regarding the question around oil exports, one of our most profitable industries. Elements from the Mestizo majority Eastern Bolivia are supporting further gas exports, while Indigenous communities propose more focus on social development making this referendum into one where Bolivia's ethnic divides are crystal clear."
 bolivia_misc.1.a: "Oil money should go for development"
 bolivia_misc.1.b: "Oil exports will improve our standing"
 bolivia_ethnic.1.t: "The Bolivian Armed Forces Demand The Resignation Of Our Government"
 bolivia_ethnic.1.d: "With a recent peak in tensions with Eastern Bolivia's Mestizo majority and recent protests, the chief of staff of the Bolivian Armed Forces, has demanded the resignation of our government and the placement of a new interim government led by the pro-Mestizo [conservatism_L] which will lead Bolivia into fresh elections, furthermore stating that refusal to do so will lead to drastic consequences. While compliance will lead to the undermining of democratic institutions, it will at least avoid a repeat of Bolivia's many military dictatorships, which ended in 1982. However We also must not allow the Army to intervene in politics, and we can try and resist their pressures, which however may lead to drastic consequences. Whatever choice we make it will drastically affect Bolivia's future."
 bolivia_ethnic.1.a: "Our time is over, we have to step down"
 bolivia_ethnic.1.b: "We will not return to the past!"
 bolivia_ethnic.2.t: "The Bolivian Armed Forces March On La Paz"
 bolivia_ethnic.2.d: "After our decision to refuse the military's ultimatum, they took the matters into their own hands, marching military units into La Paz and seizing control of the Presidential Palace and Congress. The Armed Forces have declared a state of emergency and also declared that they shall 'restore Bolivia's rightful place in Latin America', and while they promised that democracy will return it seems unlikely the Military plans on doing so."
 bolivia_ethnic.2.a: "Bolivia is saved from the Indians!"
 bolivia_news.1.t: "Bolivian Government Resigns After Military Pressure"
 bolivia_news.1.d: "With recent tensions between the pro-indigenous Bolivian government and the majority of Eastern Bolivia's ethnic Mestizo population, the Bolivian Armed Forces issued an ultimatum, demanding the resignation of the government and the placement of a new interim government led by prominent pro-mestizo opposition parties which will lead the country to new elections. Fearing a new military regime like in the past, the government complied and stepped down and [BOL.GetLeader] was later sworn in as Bolivia's new interim president. while [BOL.GetLeader] claims that the new government is restoring democratic rule, many commentators have agreed that the new government has taken a harsh anti-indigenous stance with many reports of use of force against indigenous protests by the Bolivian Armed Forces."
 bolivia_news.1.a: "A bad day for democracy"
 bolivia_news.2.t: "The Bolivian Armed Forces Topple Bolivia's Government In Military Coup"
 bolivia_news.2.d: "With recent tensions between the pro-indigenous Bolivian government and the majority of Eastern Bolivia's ethnic Mestizo population, the Bolivian Armed Forces issued an ultimatum, demanding the resignation of the government and the placement of a new interim government led by prominent pro-mestizo opposition parties which will lead the country to new elections. Fearing a new military regime like in the past, the government refused to comply and instead the military stormed the capital of La Paz, seizing the presidential palace and congress. Later the military declared a state of emergency and stated that they shall 'restore Bolivia's rightful place in Latin America', which many commentators agree will raise new regional tensions, and also put a bad track record on Bolivia's democracy which experienced the 191th coup since it's declaration of independence in 1825, the last being in 1980.
