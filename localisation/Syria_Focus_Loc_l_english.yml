 #Events
 Syria.1.t:0 "Victory in the Civil War!"
 Syria.1.SYR.desc:0 "We have finally beaten both the forces of the Syrian opposition and the disgusting Islamists of Tahrir Al-Sham and ISIS. We can now start rebuilding our country and focusing on the future."
 Syria.1.FSA.desc:0 "The dictatorial regime of Assad has fallen, and we've neutralised the threat of the Islamists. Syria is finally free!"
 Syria.1.NUS.desc:0 "Allah has granted us victory over dictator Assad and the Free Syrian Army. This is truly a divine sign, making our cause more just than ever"
 Syria.1.a:0 "No Power Can Overcome Us!"
 Syria.2.t:0 "The Fate of Tahrir Al-Sham"
 Syria.2.desc:0 "Throughout the Syrian civil war, we've had an uneasy alliance with the Tahrir Al-Sham, also known as the Al-Nusra Front. We have avoided conflict with them, so we could focus on taking out the Assad regime. However, as the dust settles, our forces are starting across the border at theirs.\n\nWe could continue the civil war, and take them out. On the other hand, we could promise them representation in whatever government we will form in the future, and they will most likely demand us to hold to that promise."
 Syria.2.a:0 "Offer them representation"
 Syria.2.b:0 "Take them out!"
 Syria.3.t:0 "Syrian Opposition Offers Representation"
 Syria.3.desc:0 "The Syrian Opposition has contacted us and offered a position in their government. They promise that we will be able to operate politically in the coming regime. It is likely that if we refuse they will start military actions against us."
 Syria.3.a:0 "We will rule Syria together"
 Syria.3.b:0 "Never! We need to take them out!"
 Syria.4.t:0 "Tahrir Al-Sham Joins the Opposition"
 Syria.4.desc:0 "Tahrir Al-Sham has agreed to join our government after being promised representation. We need to remember not to exclude them..."
 Syria.4.a:0 "Huzzah for united Syria!"
 Syria.5.t:0 "Tahrir Al-Sham Resists"
 Syria.5.desc:0 "Tahrir Al-Sham has refused to agree to our terms. I guess we'll have to do this the old way..."
 Syria.5.a:0 "Strike them before they strike us!"
 Syria.6.t:0 "The Status of Rojava"
 Syria.6.desc:0 "The Rojava are a Kurdish dominated self-governing area in northern Syria. During the civil war, they fought mainly against ISIS with other secular and progressive militias and factions. Their end goal was to create a federal Syrian republic, though many see the area just as Western Kurdistan. Demanding that they submit to us will most likely lead into a civil war. We could always offer them limited autonomy, though this means we won't be able to fully control them. Letting them go might increase Kurdish nationalism in the area."
 Syria.6.a:0 "The area is part of Syria"
 Syria.6.b:0 "Offer them autonomy"
 Syria.6.c:0 "Give them independence"
 Syria.7.t:0 "Syria Demands Subjugation"

 Syria.9.a:0 "For united Syria!"
 Syria.10.t:0 "Autonomy Offered"
 Syria.10.desc:0 "The government in Damascus is offering as an autonomous status in Syria. This is what we fought for in the civil war. On the other hand, we are in a position of power, maybe we should set more ambitious goals?"
 Syria.10.a:0 "This is what we wanted..."
 Syria.10.b:0 "...but not anymore"
 Syria.11.t:0 "Rojava Agree to Autonomy"
 Syria.11.desc:0 "Rojava has agreed to join back with Syria after promises of autonomy. We need to remember to honor this promise"
 Syria.11.a:0 "For united Syria!"
 Syria.12.t:0 "The Status of SSNP in Syria"
 Syria.12.desc:0 "During the Syrian Civil War, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP for short) first switched sides against the regime, but eventually realigned themselves with Assad. Their militias were a keyfactor in Assad's victory, and they have been gaining popularity as a political party as well. Keeping them around will ensure their militias are at Assad's service, but this will increase their influence. Purging them might lead to resistance from them later on./n/nHow should we advise Assad?"
 Syria.12.a:0 "Assad needs SSNP militias"
 Syria.12.b:0 "Better get rid of them"
 Syria.13.t:0 "[From.GetName] Opinion on SSNP"

 Syria.14.desc:0 "The Rojava are a Kurdish dominated self-governing area in northern Syria.

We could always offer them limited autonomy, though this means we won't be able to fully control them. Letting them go might increase Kurdish nationalism in the area."
 Syria.14.a:0 "The area is part of Syria"
 Syria.14.b:0 "Offer them autonomy"
 Syria.14.c:0 "Give them independence"

 SyriaNews.2.t:0 "Truce Between FSA and Tahrir Al-Sham Collapses"

 SyriaNews.3.t:0 "Free Syrian Army and Tahrir Al-Sham Unite"

 SyriaNews.4.t:0 "Liberation of Rojava"

Shortly after the announcement, the foreign ministries of Turkey, Iraq and Iran released statements that 'This decision will only bring more instability for the region'"
 SyriaNews.4.a:0 "Interesting"
 SyriaNews.5.t:0 "Integration of Rojava"
 SyriaNews.5.d:0 "The officials of Rojava have agreed that the areas controlled by them are to be integrated back into Syria. They have also agreed to revert back to the status they had before the civil war started. This decision has left many veterans of the war angry at their leaders, feeling that their bloodshed has been for nothing"
 SyriaNews.5.a:0 "Interesting"
 SyriaNews.6.t:0 "Autonomy for Rojava"
 SyriaNews.6.d:0 "Negotiations between Syrian and Rojava officials have finally ended, and the two governments have reached an agreement. The Syrian government has promised increased federalisation to the peoples of Syria, and in exchange the Rojava will not pursue any more separation from Syria"

 SyriaNews.7.t:0 "Renewal of Conflict in Syria"
 SyriaNews.7.d:0 "Negotiations between Syria and the Rojava have broked down, as the two parties didn't see eye-to-eye on the future of Northern Syria. It seems like there might be another conflict brewing in Syria"
