 japan_classic.1.d2: "Japan has suggested to their alliance leader, [From.GetName], that we would make a formidable faction member of their military alliance. The [From.GetAdjective] leader [From.GetLeader] apparently agrees and has approached us about a possible alliance entry of our nation."

 japan_classic.2.t: "The push for Korean Unification"

 japan_classic.3.t: "Japan offers to strike North Korea together"
 japan_classic.3.d: "Our conflict with the North Koreans has been going on for too long; a stalemate nobody is willing to break. But, with a new ally, we could overpower the North Koreans and finally reunite our people.\nThis ally has now revealed themselves to be Japan, which offers to aid us reuniting our country. Their only demand is simple: No concessions to totalitarianism. Total war until freedom is won."
 japan_classic.3.o1: "We will reunite our country!"
 japan_classic.3.o2: "We cannot do this."
 japan_classic.4.t: "Japan and South Korea march on Pyongyang"
 japan_classic.4.d: "The Japanese and South Korean governments have made a joint statement that they would reunite Korea by force. China needs to act now or risks losing their vital buffer state against its East Asian rival. Should we aid Pyongyang? Or leave them to suffer?"

 japan_classic.4.o2: "North Korea is insignificant."
 japan_classic.5.t: "China intervenes!"

 japan_classic.9.o1: "Victory indeed!"
 japan_classic.10.t: "The Chinese Ultimatum"
 japan_classic.10.d: "With Pyongyang out of the way, Beijing has to be our next goal to bring democracy to. China is a completely different enemy from North Korea and the chance that they fold is almost non-existent. We need to be aware that this will cause the war everyone is Asia is afraid of."
 japan_classic.10.o1: "Victory is our destiny!"
 japan_classic.11.t: "Japan offers to send an Ultimatum to China"
 japan_classic.11.d: "The Japanese government has approached us with a simple deal akin to what they already did with Korea: Stop the division of the country by invading the non-democratic part and uniting it under the democratic one.\nHow should we react?"
 japan_classic.11.o1: "We agree!"
 japan_classic.11.o2: "War is not our goal!"
 japan_classic.12.t: "Japan and Taiwan demand unification!"
 japan_classic.12.d: "The governments of Japan and Taiwan have demanded that China be reunited under the democratic leadership of Taiwan and that the [CHI.GetRulingParty] is dissolved in China.\nOur generals laugh at their pretensions. We are gearing for war already."

 japan_classic.15.d: "Keizō Obuchi, a loyal servant of the Liberal Democratic Party and the Japanese people, had been Prime Minister of Japan since July 30th, 1998 after the resignation of Ryūtarō Hashimoto after the LDP lost the Upper House election of 1998.\nKeizō Obuchi has been described as calm, qualified and efficient - but few people saw his sudden health drop coming. On April 1st, 2000, Obuchi suffered a stroke and was rushed to a hospital."
 japan_classic.15.o1: "Let's hope for the best."
 japan_classic.16.t: "Replacing Obuchi"
 japan_classic.16.d: "Shortly after Keizō Obuchi's severe stroke, it was clear that he would not quickly be available for service again. The Japanese diet met on April 5th, 2000, to find a replacement for the Prime Minister.\nKeizō Obuchi would never recover again, eventually dying in the hospital on May 14th. He leaves behind one son and two daughters, one of them, Yūko, also a politician of the Liberal Democrats."

 japan_classic.17.o1: "We will send all help needed."
 japan_classic.17.o2: "The situation will rectify itself."
 japan_classic.18.t: "Yoshirō Mori's political gaffe"
 japan_classic.18.d: "On May 15th, 2000, newly elected Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori got into major negative headlines for the first time when he publicly referred to Japan as \"a Divine Nation centered on the Emperor\". This, in the eyes of both the opposition and the ruling LDP, calls the democratic ideals of Japan as well as the role of the monarchy into question.\nPublic approval ratings of the Prime Minister have dropped."
 japan_classic.18.o1: "What a fool!"
 japan_classic.18.o2: "Double down on his statements."
 japan_classic.19.t: "Fusako Shigenobu arrested"
 japan_classic.19.d: "The leader of the Japanese Red Army, Fusako Shigenobu, was arrested in Osaka on November 8th, 2000.\nThe Japanese Red Army was a militant communist militia aiming to destroy the monarchy, topple the Japanese government and start a world revolution.\nFollowing the arrests, the Japanese Red Army would soon be disbanded in early 2001."
 japan_classic.19.o1: "The communist rebels are losing ground."
 japan_classic.19.o2: "Set her free, she is right."
 japan_classic.20.t: "The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster"
 japan_classic.20.d: "On March 11th, 2011, Japan was hit by the devastating Tōhoku earthquake, followed by a tsunami, primarily hitting the north-eastern coast of the island of Honshū.\n\nMany Japanese citizens were displaced and had to leave their homes, but this is not out of the ordinary for a country living on the Pacific Fire Ring. However, the damage done to Fukushima Daiichi, one of Japan's most vital nuclear reactors, is not only out of the ordinary, but absolutely catastrophic.\nIn a nuclear disaster that only Chernobyl 1986 could measure up to, the tsunami destroyed the emergency reactors that were to cool the reactors after the automatic shutdown. The Units 1, 2 and 3 suffered nuclear meltdowns, being accompanied by hydrogen-air chemical explosions and massive release of radioactive material.\n\nThe radiation emitted by the reactor was strong enough to sentence an unprotected human to death after a mere minute; the regional area thus became uninhabitable.\n\nThe catastrophe changed public opinion on nuclear power the world over."
 japan_classic.20.o1: "A black day for our nation."

 japan_classic.70.t: "Japan seeks Chinese Alliance"
 japan_classic.70.d: "The Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] has recently announced that Japan would seek a new possible alliance with its former rival and constant adversary China.\nThe Chinese have yet to respond - but whatever Beijing's decision might be, the political climate of East Asia is changing."
 japan_classic.70.o1: "A new age!"
 japan_classic.70.o2: "Let us hope for the best."
 japan_classic.70.o3: "We shall consider our choices."
 japan_classic.70.o4: "The Chinese will make a good choice."
 japan_classic.70.o5: "How odd."
 japan_classic.70.o6: "We will destroy them anyway."
 japan_classic.71.t: "Japan embraces the Path of War!"
 japan_classic.71.d: "\"The grand Japanese heritage cannot be put into question by our past experiences and our most shameful defeat in 1945. We need to put our country and our national pride back on its feet and look forward, united, strengthened and ready to strike. We will not avoid conflict just to preserve peace. Not anymore!\"\n\nThe Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] held quite the sensational speech in Tokyo. Japan seems to have renewed ambitions for superpower status."
 japan_classic.71.o1: "We are unstoppable!"
 japan_classic.71.o2: "Hail Japan!"
 japan_classic.71.o3: "Very worrying."
 japan_classic.71.o4: "They need to be stopped."
 japan_classic.71.o5: "Do they want to get nuked AGAIN?"
 japan_classic.72.t: "Japan seeks Trade with China"
 japan_classic.72.d: "Denying American advances into the Japanese economy, the Tokyo government has announced that they would instead seek closer trade relationships with the Chinese, rather than 'selling the Japanese people to the Americans', according to the Japanese Minister of Finance."
 japan_classic.72.o1: "Good choice"
 japan_classic.72.o2: "Intriguing."
 japan_classic.72.o3: "That comes close to betrayal."
 japan_classic.72.o4: "Interesting Development"
 japan_classic.73.t: "Japan adapts Article 9"
 japan_classic.73.d: "Article 9 of the Japanese constitution states: \"Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.\"\nThis has been interpreted to not only outlaw war, but also military action abroad. The Japanese government is now getting rid of the latter clause - putting fear in the opposition that the former might be next."
 japan_classic.73.o1: "It had to be done."
 japan_classic.73.o2: "Japan is remilitarizing."
 japan_classic.74.t: "Japan abandons Defensive Principles"
 japan_classic.74.d: "With the world growing more and more tense, the Japanese government has today declared that it would be ready to defend Japanese interests and its ideological persistence both at home and, importantly, abroad.\n\nThis is a major uproar in Japanese foreign policy."
 japan_classic.74.o1: "Glory to Japan!"
 japan_classic.74.o2: "We stand by our ally."
 japan_classic.74.o3: "How worrying."
 japan_classic.74.o4: "Death to Japan!"
 japan_classic.75.t: "Japan declares Interventionism"
 japan_classic.75.d: "Japan has reassured the global community that it would stand strong in its democratic values, but that it would also pursue a more aggressive foreign policy to enforce democratic principles both at home and abroad."
 japan_classic.75.o1: "Freedom we bring and fascists we slay."
 japan_classic.75.o2: "Good choice"
 japan_classic.75.o3: "Defending democracy is a good thing at least."
 japan_classic.75.o4: "Another one of those 'democrats'. Ugh."
 japan_classic.75.o5: "We will destroy these Japs!"
 japan_classic.76.t: "Japan abolishes the Monarchy"
 japan_classic.76.d: "In a move that draws closer and closer to communistic ideology, the Japanese government has today dismantled the Chrysanthemum Throne, the position of the Japanese Emperor. The first emperor, as according to legend, sat on the throne around 650 BC; and the first confirmed emperor did so in 100 BC. Either way, the Japanese monarchy was the longest-existing monarchy in the world."
 japan_classic.76.o1: "Good riddance."
 japan_classic.76.o2: "Everything has to come to an end."
 japan_classic.77.t: "Japan empowers the Emperor"
 japan_classic.77.d: "\"Japan, in these troubled times, requires a strong and unifying leader, something that I cannot offer.\"\nThe Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] has today angered the opposition of his country and many countries across the world by giving a speech about a possible restoration of Absolute Monarchy in Japan. [JAP.GetLeader] has presented several reforms (that are expected to pass) to the National Diet in order to make the transition happen."
 japan_classic.77.o1: "Long live the Empire!"
 japan_classic.77.o2: "The Japanese are doing the right thing."
 japan_classic.77.o3: "So much for values."
 japan_classic.78.t: "Japan seeks to spread the Revolution"
 japan_classic.78.d: "\"The people of Korea are in desperate need of liberation and their workers shall be freed.\", the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Japan has declared in Tokyo.\nThis is a complete novelty in foreign policy and could mean a war in East Asia."
 japan_classic.78.o1: "Glory to Japan!"
 japan_classic.78.o2: "This is outrageous!"
 japan_classic.78.o3: "The Red Revolution is spreading!"
 japan_classic.78.o4: "We need to fight communism!"
 japan_classic.78.o5: "Totalitarianism is spreading."
 japan_classic.79.t: "Japan declares Racial Supremacy"
 japan_classic.79.d: "\"And thus, with scientific and cultural evidence, we have definitive proof that the Japanese people are the chosen race.\"\nEven if the Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] did not present the evidence he spoke of, the implications of a Japanese return to fascism through a declaration of 'racial supremacy' are very severe. Japanese foreign aggression has become very real."
 japan_classic.79.o1: "Hail us!"
 japan_classic.79.o2: "They are going crazy."
 japan_classic.80.t: "[Root.GetName] declares Mass Mobilization"
 japan_classic.80.d: "\"In the name of the safety of our people, our nation and our friends, we need every available recruit. The cynical opposition and our enemies will call this 'mass mobilization', we should rather refer to it as 'national awakening' however. This has nothing to do with foreign aggression.\"\nIn an act of foreign aggression, [Root.GetLeader], head of the [Root.GetAdjective] government, has declared a state of mass mobilization in the country."
 japan_classic.80.o1: "For the fatherland!"
 japan_classic.80.o2: "We still have their backs."
 japan_classic.80.o3: "Let's hope they don't become a threat."
 japan_classic.80.o4: "The [Root.GetAdjective] threat is growing."
 japan_classic.80.o5: "We will enjoy killing these recruits."
 japan_classic.81.t: "The Korean Unification Ultimatum"
 japan_classic.81.d: "In an originally Japanese proposal, the Tokyo and Seoul governments have issued a joint statement called \"Joint Japanese-Korean Demand for Democracy for the Korean People\", in which the two countries threaten North Korea with war in order to unify the Korean Peninsula under Seoul leadership.\nA response is expected not only from Pyongyang, but also from Beijing."
 japan_classic.81.o1: "Let's go!"
 japan_classic.81.o2: "How dare they?!"
 japan_classic.81.o3: "We will stand by our allies."
 japan_classic.81.o4: "Pyongyang is justified."
 japan_classic.81.o5: "What is even happening?"
 japan_classic.82.t: "China beats Japan into submission!"
 japan_classic.82.d: "Japan has dropped its demands to the North Korean after the Chinese government called out partial mobilization of its forces and began moving towards the North Korean border, ready to cross it like they did in the 1950s to once again save Pyongyang from utter destruction.\nJapanese diplomatic reputation is tarnished and South Korea has made a fool of itself."
 japan_classic.82.o1: "Shameful display!"
 japan_classic.82.o2: "Victory is our destiny!"
 japan_classic.82.o3: "It is peace in our time."
 japan_classic.83.t: "China refuses to aid North Korea!"
 japan_classic.83.d: "\"The Chinese government has no further interest in propping up the failed North Korean state. Our protection for them is null and void.\"\nIn an unprecedented and unexpected move, the Chinese government has abandoned North Korea to its fate in the face of approaching Japanese and South Korean troops."
 japan_classic.83.o1: "And what a good choice that is."
 japan_classic.83.o2: "It had to be done."
 japan_classic.83.o3: "TRAITORS! TRAITORS!"
 japan_classic.83.o4: "North Korea stands no chance."
 japan_classic.84.t: "North Korean officials flee the country!"
 japan_classic.84.d: "In the middle of the night, North Korean government officials have fled the country in the face of growing civil resentment and the impending Japanese and South Korean invasion. Several trains left the country for Russia and China, with a government-in-exile possibly in the process of being formed."
 japan_classic.84.o1: "That means victory!"
 japan_classic.84.o2: "Well, they can have refuge for now."
 japan_classic.84.o3: "Farewell, world."
 japan_classic.84.o4: "North Korea is no more."
 japan_classic.85.t: "The North unites Korea!"
 japan_classic.85.d: "\"This is the greatest victory of our time. The once oppressed people of the south are now free to live and enjoy life together with their northern brethren, as the almighty eternal ruler intended.\"\nNorth Korean Leader [NKO.GetLeader] held a speech in Seoul, the former capital of South Korea, today. South Korea has failed in the eternal struggle of these two different versions of a Korean nation state. The entire country is now ruled from Pyongyang."
 japan_classic.85.o1: "Glorious!"
 japan_classic.85.o2: "The dawn of a new era."
 japan_classic.86.t: "The South unites Korea!"
 japan_classic.86.d: "\"And thus, we bring the people of North Korea our freedoms and our rights and our virtues, as they are finally free from their oppressors and their slave holders, finally free from slavery and totalitarian rule.\"\nSouth Korean President [KOR.GetLeader] held a speech in Pyongyang, the former capital city of North Korea, today. In the seemingly eternal struggle of the two Koreas against each other, North Korea finally collapsed and gave way to a stronger South Korea, now simply called Korea. The Seoul government has united the Korean people under an independent, united and sovereign government for the first time since the Japanese invaded the Empire of Korea in 1910."
 japan_classic.86.o1: "Unity at last!"
 japan_classic.86.o2: "A new age has begun."
 japan_classic.87.t: "China reunites with Taiwan!"
 japan_classic.87.d: "China has annexed the former 'Republic of China', also known as Taiwan, which had been exiled to the island of the same name since 1950."
 japan_classic.87.o1: "Finally"
 japan_classic.87.o2: "Alright."
 japan_classic.88.t: "Taiwan reconquers China!"
 japan_classic.88.d: "Taiwan has restored its dominance over the territories of the former People's Republic of China. This means that the Republic of China is truly China once more."
 japan_classic.88.o1: "Glorious!"
 japan_classic.88.o2: "Incredible!"
 japan_classic.89.t: "The Fukushima disaster"
 japan_classic.89.d: "North-eastern Honshū was hit by the Tōhoku earthquake on March 11th, 2011.\nThis earthquake and the subsequent tsunami severely damaged the nuclear power reactor Fukushima Daiichi, which suffered a faulty emergency shutdown and then went on to losing three of its four main units to nuclear meltdowns. This is possibly the greatest nuclear disaster in history, only matched by the 1986 Chernobyl incident."
 japan_classic.89.o1: "Disastrous!"
 japan_classic.89.o2: "Excellent."

 Japan.1.t: "Naka-Meguro Derailment"
 Japan.1.d: "On March 8th, 2000, around 9 AM Japanese time, a TRTA Hibiya Line train was sideswiped by another train, killing 5 and injuring 63 after the rearmost car of the train had derailed in a tight curve, crashing into a bypassing vehicle."

 Japan.3.a: "Atarashī Tennŝ Heika!"
 Japan.8.t: "China is Demanding the Senkaku Islands!"
 Japan.8.d: "China has revived their dispute with us over ownership of the Senkaku islands. If we give in to their demands we might increase China's confidence in its ability to influence our foreign policy as well as reduce our popularity among the more nationalistic of our people. However, the consequences of refusing probably do not bode well for us either."
 Japan.8.a: "Let them have their fishing rights..."
 Japan.8.b: "Japan will not be intimidated!"
 Japan.4.t: "Japan has Handed Over the Islands!"

However this time our fighters were fired upon by the Chinese, resulting in the deaths of several of our pilots and the loss of multiple aircraft. We should evaluate whether this incident, given China's recent actions, was a deliberate provocation or an unfortunate accident and decide our response accordingly."
 Japan.6.a: "We have a right to self-defense!"
 Japan.6.b: "We should call upon our protectors!"
 Japan.6.c: "This was probably an accident..."
 Japan.7.t: "Chinese and Japanese Fighter Jets Engage in Aerial Combat"
 Japan.7.d: "The East China Sea has erupted into conflict following a confrontation between Chinese and Japanese aircraft. The clash reportedly began when Japanese jets were scrambled to intercept Chinese fighters over Japanese airspace. Rather than resulting in a Chinese retreat which has historically occurred after similar incidents, Japanese aircraft were fired upon, resulting in the deaths of several Japanese pilots and the loss of multiple aircraft. [JAP.GetLeader] has strongly condemned the incident and is reportedly engaged in urgent talks behind closed doors regarding Japan's response to this event."

 JAP_deflation_desc: "Following the 1987 Tokyo Stock Market Crash and the burst of the 1992 Asset Price Bubble, Japan's economy has been in decline. With huge government bailouts to prop up key enterprises and banks, the response to the crisis built up one of the largest public debts in the world. The bad business environment in Japan leads Japanese corporations to invest very little inside of Japan, with profits instead put into abroad or government bonds to sustain the huge debt. Due to deflation, the rise in the value of the Yen, this gives stable profits for savers even with minuscule or negative interest rates, leaving no incentives to consume or invest in the real economy. This deflation allows Japan to sustain huge debts that would make any other country bankrupt. Unfortunately, it also ensures anemic economic growth with no solution in sight."

 JAP_neoliberalism_TT: "\n§GNeoliberalism will quickly escape deflation by boosting the available workforce and reducing staffing needs to immediately fill positions, rather than directly growing the population.§!\n§RIt will later struggle to maintain this level of growth, depending more on social services or foreign puppets to grow its GDP.§!\n\n§GThis path favors aggressive investment and expansionism.§!"
 JAP_socialism_TT: "\n§GSocialism will gradually escape deflation by growing the population and decreasing the expectation of social subsidies to satisfy the population. It synergizes well with the Trade Unions internal faction.§!\n§RIt will resolve the depopulation issue quickly, but the effects will take longer to reach the economy.§!\n\n§GThis path favors vertical growth and pacifism.§!"
 JAP_union_interest_TT: "§GThis will satisfy the labor unions!§!\n"

 JAP_large_boned_policy: "'Honebuto' Policy"
 JAP_large_boned_policy_desc: "Normally, the Ministry of Finance drafts the national budget based on the ruling party's positions. Some in the LDP are calling for this arrangement to be revised in order to combat the consquences of the Lost Decade, giving the Diet greater influence over what the Ministry of Finance proposes. They are calling this the 'Big-Boned' policy."
 JAP_socialism: "Japanese Socialism"
 JAP_socialism_desc: "The welfare of Japanese citizens cannot end at pensions and healthcare. Childcare and elderly that do not have families to rely on must be covered as well. We cannot allow this become a partisan issue! "
 JAP_protect_worker_rights: "Protect Workers' Rights"
 JAP_protect_worker_rights_desc: "Words are not enough. To guarantee the rights of workers- and to placate the unions- we will pass some simple legislation to extend workers' rights to temporary contractors who do not typically enjoy the same protections as traditional employees."
 JAP_save_ice_age: "Save the Ice Age Generation!"
 JAP_save_ice_age_desc: "During the Lost Decade, an entire generation of graduates became stranded with no opportunities by a failing economy. The effects of this have been catastrophic, with spiking rates of suicide and a sense of hopelessness among young adults who have given up on society. Some of these fall to despondent, radical thoughts. We must provide hope to the Lost Generation."
 JAP_neoliberalism: "Japanese Neoliberalism"
 JAP_neoliberalism_desc: "We must enrich all Japanese citizens by providing them the opportunity to succeed. To that end, we must help businesses grow. We must not be tempted by easy taxation promises that will strangle our tender economy and impoverish more than ever before."
 JAP_deregulate_temporary_staffing: "Deregulate Temporary Staffing"
 JAP_deregulate_temporary_staffing_desc: "One measure we can immediately take to promote growth is to extend the circumstances in which companies can legally staff positions with temporary contractors. This will help get more people working without businesses needing to commit to hiring them as an employee, at least for some time. Of course, the unions will object."
 JAP_national_investments: "Assertive Samurai Bond Investment"
 JAP_national_investments_desc: "Japan enjoys one advantage from its tepid interest rates- it is quite attractive to foreign actors that wish to seek investment from Japanese investors. We could liquidate a few of our unprofitable international investments in order to finance some bond packages with some of our neighbors, which could have a positive effect on our domestic economy."
 JAP_liberal_syndicalism: "Trade Union Representatives"
 JAP_liberal_syndicalism_desc: "Reserving some seats in the Diet for representatives of major trade unions would give the unions a direct route to address their concerns to the national assembly and make them more cooperative with political issues. The question is, how much influence do we actually want to give them over elections?"
 JAP_labour_management: "Labour Management Director"
 JAP_labour_management_desc: "Ideally, businesses should resolve labour issues before they become an issue of national policy. To accomplish this, we will reward large businesses that reserve a seat on their board of directors for trade union representatives."
 JAP_industrial_union: "National Labour Union"
 JAP_industrial_union_desc: "In Japan, the local unions are the first negotiator in labour disputes before they have a chance to escalate. Normally, the labour federations help fund the smaller unions with their dues, but this means that many local unions must make do with inadequate funding. We will standardize how dues are collected and distribute them to each union directly."
 JAP_struggle_high_low: "The Struggle of High and Low"
 JAP_struggle_high_low_desc: "It is too simplistic to blame everything on capitalism, or to dismiss our reforms as communism. Our nation must be unified in spirit, devoted to each other and our respective talents. The worker and the owner, the state and the citizen, each of these cannot exist without the other. We will become one organism, and overcome adversity together."
 JAP_universal_child_benefit: "Universal Child Benefit"
 JAP_universal_child_benefit_desc: "The government will grant the subsidy of growth, to every child, born in Japan, growing in Japan, and going to any schools in Japan, without any discrimination by the familial roots."
 JAP_ban_zangyo: "Ban Minashi Zangyou"
 JAP_ban_zangyo_desc: "Karoshi- death by overwork- has been on the rise for several years, as a consequence of a shrinking workforce. We cannot overcome the societal pressure to accept predatory overtime expectations through social change alone, we must leglislate protection that protects workers from their own sense of obligation."
 JAP_nenko_wage: "Reinterpret the Nenko Wage System"
 JAP_nenko_wage_desc: "The old seniority-wage system was flawed in many ways, but its removal has left many retirees who planned around it with insufficient savings that their pensions cannot compensate for. We're ready to change this. We can roll our social reform progress into a new pension, childcare, and unemployment system that protects all Japanese citizens."
 JAP_discretionary_labour_laws: "Legislate Discretionary Labour"
 JAP_discretionary_labour_laws_desc: "Discretionary labour allows for an employee's salary to factor potential overtime into a static rate, which enables employers to supervise their employees less. Of course, this method can and has been abused to pressure employees to work more for less pay. We need to make sure it's flexible but fair. "
 JAP_subsidy_optimization: "Subsidy Optimization"
 JAP_subsidy_optimization_desc: "One of the largest complaints that small businsses have with applying for subsidies is how top heavy the system feels. For a simple bond or relief package, the noodle stand must fill out the same paperwork meant for Mitsubishi. We will have to dedicate a lot of effort to changing this, but we will remove one of the largest impediments to small businesses."
 JAP_elder_labour: "Shogai Gen'eki"
 JAP_elder_labour_desc: "We have made mistakes with handling the older generation in the workplace. We should not force them out of work, but we must also support those whose financial situations necessitate a return to work. We should provide resources to help small businesses coordinate with interested elderly workers to live an 'Active Long Life'."
 JAP_rebuild_lost_generation: "Rebuild the Lost Generation"
 JAP_rebuild_lost_generation_desc: "The shape of labour in Japan is forever changed, and the workforce is finally starting to become comfortable with that fact. Young workers feel that they can balance their work and life, older workers feel valued by their companies and communities. And, we did it without destroying our economy!"
 JAP_price_escalation: "Controlled Price Escalation"
 JAP_price_escalation_desc: "Businesses are growing the fastest they have in a decade, but we need to prepare for a wave of labour returning to the workforce. We will print enough currency to encourage new construction, but we must capitalize on this burst of growth in order for it to be worth the resulting devaluation of the Yen that will follow!"
 JAP_counter_union: "Cabinet-Led Union Counter-Offensive"
 JAP_counter_union_desc: "Large and small companies alike are complaining that union demands are depressing their ability to hire more contract workers. We need to push back against the labour unions' influence in major industrial conglomerates with an information campaign to lower worker membership rates."
 JAP_union_liaison: "Council for Industrial-Union Affairs"
 JAP_union_liaison_desc: "We have dramatically modernized the way labour in Japan functions, and not all aspects of industry have been able to catch up. We need to ensure that the trade union federations and the industrial interests are able to shake hands after so much of society has changed. To do this, we will create a council to coordinate the needs of both."
 JAP_national_minimum_wage: "National Minimum Wage"
 JAP_national_minimum_wage_desc: "Japan's minimum wages are different among the prefectures; it is higher in the metropolis like Tokyo and Osaka, and lower in the countryside like Aomori and Kagoshima. If the wages are standardised across the country, ."
 JAP_intern_training: "Technical Intern Training Program"
 JAP_intern_training_desc: "The developing countries of East Asia, in particular, have a growing demand for advanced technological training. At the same time, we need to fill positions with temporary workers. This is a great way to provide a modest boost to our workforce, but we must take care that we treat these interns humanely, otherwise this could look bad for us with our neighbors."
 JAP_relaxed_immigration: "Relax Immigration Restrictions"
 JAP_relaxed_immigration_desc: "Japan's population needs to recover before it can begin to recover its economy. The simple fact is that the population cannot recover until the econom does. We are stuck in a paradox that can only be solved from outside. This will make many people on both sides of the political arena upset, but this is a matter of national survival."
 JAP_migrant_monitoring: "National Migrant Database"
 JAP_migrant_monitoring_desc: "A strong migrant population is great for the workforce, but our relaxed policies must be compensated with careful monitoring of suspicious persons who reside in our country. A comprehensive list of all migrants- and their history- can only be accomplished with computer assistance. We will apprehend and deport those who cannot abide by Japanese law before they can bring harm to our citizens."
 JAP_improved_naturalization: "Help Foreign Workers"
 JAP_improved_naturalization_desc: "We will reorganize some tax laws and coordinate with several countries we already have visa agreements with so that foreign workers will enjoy more favorable financial conditions while working in Japan, such as streamlining their tax documentation. This does not mean we will commit to more open immigration, but we will make life easier for foreign workers."
 JAP_control_labour_immigrants: "Streamlined Naturalization Process"
 JAP_control_labour_immigrants_desc: "We will standardize a way for foreign nationals seeking permanent residency to accelerate their application. Normally, foreign nationals must reside in Japan for 10 years before earning eligibility for permanent residency. If they speak Japanese fluently and have a stable source of income and career experience, this could be shortened to just 3 years."
 JAP_maternity_tax_reduction: "Expanded Maternity Benefits"
 JAP_maternity_tax_reduction_desc: "Women on maternity leave receive several benefits and compensation already, but we can extend this to fathers taking time off to take care of their family. Additionally, we can subsidize families for each additional child they have. It will be expensive, and reduce our nominal workforce for a time, but the baby boom will pay off."
 JAP_adoption_tax_reduction: "Expanded Family Campaign"
 JAP_adoption_tax_reduction_desc: "Unfortunately, many couples that don't fit into the image of the traditional Japanese family are exempt from many benefits afforded to typical families. Expanding our support for adoption is a great way for us to help house children that otherwise must remain under the direct care of the state."
 JAP_shine_all_women: "A Society Where All Women Shine"
 JAP_shine_all_women_desc: "Japan must adapt its expectations as a modern society. Men must no longer feel that they are expected to be the sole providers for a family any longer. We must encourage women who are willing to support a family with a full time job. To do this, we must encourage women to seek opportunity- and assure them that they will not be turned away."
 JAP_yamato_nadeshiko: "Yamato Nadeshiko"
 JAP_yamato_nadeshiko_desc: "In order to inspire and motivate women, we must change the way they are viewed by society. They must not be treated as delicate flowers to shun when they reach towards opportunity. Japan cannot remain in the past- we must be willing to let go, even if it means leaving behind a piece of our sentimentality in the past."

 JAP_central_government_reform: "Central Government Reform"
 JAP_central_government_reform_desc: "Despite actions to privatize many companies in the 80s and 90s, the bureaucatic system that runs Japan's services is inefficient and, in some cases, prone to corruption. Some voices call for smaller government, other voices just want greater accountability for civil servants. Either choice has its drawbacks and will not be easy to reverse course from."
 JAP_cease_privatization: "Suspend Privatization Schemes"
 JAP_cease_privatization_desc: "Cutting nationalized services will not make life easier for our citizens, and the overhead from trying to sell off shares of public companies may even increase our debt further. Instead, we should improve the bureaucratic system so that it actually delivers what the people expect from it and, most importantly, is trusted by the people."
 JAP_cease_privatization_TT: "\n§RThis path increases government expenditure,§! §Gbut makes it easier to intervene in the economy.§!"
 JAP_full_independent_audit: "Full Independent Audit"
 JAP_full_independent_audit_desc: "The Kaikeikensain, or Board of Audit, is responsible for reviewing the government's expenditures and comparing them to the budget to ensure finances are being appropriately allocated. Often, submissions to the board are confusing and difficult to read, as the given guidelines are not subject to censure when violated. We will change this, and verify our expenditures are above, at, or below budget."
 JAP_oversight_forum: "Representative Oversight Forum"
 JAP_oversight_forum_desc: "The seats in the Diet should not just be filled with warm bodies. We will put into practice a new system of parliamentary oversight to review the local effects for the laws passed by current and previous administrations. We will collect information through surveys and non-political groups in order to repeal laws that have negatively impacted the people."
 JAP_ombudsman: "National Financial Ombudsman"
 JAP_ombudsman_desc: "Though there are options for citizens to lodge complaints at a local level, the impact of national laws on citizens is largely invisible to the national government. We can create an office designed to process complaints and disputes regarding civil services and ensure these services are reaching everyone."
 JAP_third_agrarian_reform: "Third Agrarian Reform"
 JAP_third_agrarian_reform_desc: "There are many small plots of undesirable, abandoned land that is privately owned but not being exploited for development. Due to the economic effects of the Lost Decade, there is little desire to sell off these lands, and adjacent farmers are unwilling to pay a high price. If we buy these lands at asking price and distribute them to farmers, it will stimulate the land market and increase productivity."
 JAP_continue_privatization: "Continue Privatization Efforts"
 JAP_continue_privatization_desc: "The issue of the postal service's inefficiencies and failures is the final straw in a long list of ways the Japanese bureaucratic system has betrayed the society it is supposed to provide for. We are in a unique position to change the trajectory for Japan's economy, even if the discourse surrounding it splits the party."
 JAP_continue_privatization_TT: "\n§GThis path reduces government expenditure,§! §Rbut makes it harder to intervene in the economy.§!\n\nCompleting this as the conservative wing of the §BLiberal Democratic Party§! will cause the §Yliberal§! wing of the LDP to split off and join the opposition!"
 JAP_service_corporatization: "Civil Service Corporatization"
 JAP_service_corporatization_desc: "In order to transition more civil services to the private sector, we will put up shares of these formerly nationalised services on the market. This will allow us to sell off our own shares and reduce our debt, but will throw our services into chaos, forcing us to spend more in the short term."
 JAP_corporatization_goal: "Corporatization Goal"
 JAP_corporatization_goal_desc: "Corporatization of civil services lets the government retain ownership of all shares in the company. This helps with fiscal transparency and market competition, but it doesn't help relieve our tax burden from running these companies when they do poorly. However, it is sensible to keep certain financial and infrastructure companies at this level of ownership."
 JAP_privatization_goal: "Full Privatization Goal"
 JAP_privatization_goal_desc: "Selling all shares of our reorganized service companies to stockholders has benefits beyond the added pressure to profit- we can financially assist them more readily when their market is threatened without as much public objection, as well as tax their revenue when their market is performing well."
 JAP_end_arp: "End 'Gentan' Policy"
 JAP_end_arp_desc: "The Acreage Reduction Policy is the result of a complicated price fixing scheme developed in the 70s. In short, today's large farmers take Gentan subsidies to produce soybeans or other crops in place of rice; in exchange, they limit their production of rice to keep prices high. If we're going to phase out Gentan, we need to decide how we're going to do it."
 JAP_end_arp_tt: "\n§GWe will have to balance how much expense we want to shed from our bureaucracy spending versus the overhead of supporting our agriculture.§!"
 JAP_anticorruption_committee: "Accountable Fiscal Reform"
 JAP_anticorruption_committee_desc: "A strong government must have a transparent system of accountability for all officials with the authority to make important decisions. This means more than just a strong audit board, it means close examination of all financial ties, relationships, and promises of officials. If any incident of corruption gets past this barrier, it will be embarrassing and costly for us to clean up."
 JAP_anticorruption_committee_TT: "\n§GThis path will reward us for rejecting corrupt opportunities!§!"
 JAP_digital_archives: "Digital Personnel Management"
 JAP_digital_archives_desc: "If we want to be able to manage a leviathan of state documents, submitted subsidies, and investigative subpoenas across many different prefectures, we simply cannot search each document by hand. We must convert our millions of long term documents to a secured, redundant digital storage system. This will allow any oversight bureau to track the dealings of officials much more carefully."
 JAP_anticorruption_computerization: "Oversight Reduction Policy"
 JAP_anticorruption_computerization_desc: "With a strong emphasis on countering corruption before it takes root, we can make assumptions in our fiscal and personnel policy to make effective reductions in our expenses devoted to policing our bureaucracy. We will only benefit from these optimizations, however, if we maintain a bureaucratic culture that rejects corruption."
 JAP_anticorruption_TT: "Will give §YAccountable Fiscal Reform§! the following bonuses, so long as we maintain §Gnegligible corruption§!:\nPolitical Power Gain: §G+0.25§!\nTax Revenue Multiplier: §G+5.00%§!\nPolice Cost multiplier: §G-30.00%§!"

 JAP_countercorruption_law: "Counter-Corruption Law"
 JAP_countercorruption_law_desc: "We cannot possibly create a system that will catch all cases of backdoor dealings that will also be cost effective. Instead of trying to stop corruption before it appears, we should create the framework for a system that rewards those who blow the whistle on illicit activities."
 JAP_countercorruption_law_TT: "\n§GThis path will make it easier for us to recover from corruption!§!"
 JAP_diet_countercorruption: "Expanded Diet Investigative Powers"
 JAP_diet_countercorruption_desc: "Now that we have established a precedent for cracking down on corruption, we will take the next logical step. An amendment to the Counter-Corruption law will give the Diet wide-reaching power to investigate inappropriate cordiality between officials and businesses."
 JAP_iron_triangle: "Crush the Iron Triangle"
 JAP_iron_triangle_desc: "The relationship between bureaucratic officials, businessmen, and politicians has a fatal flaw- the ambition of opposing politicians. We will push to allow the minority government in the Diet to call for special inquiries against the ruling coalition in certain circumstances. This will slow down our government's ability to act, but will make corruption almost trivial to root out by creating an incentive to find it."
 JAP_reacquire_public_corporations: "Expand Public Ownership"
 JAP_reacquire_public_corporations_desc: "Prior privatization measures were intended to reduce the national debt, but the economic slump has not produced the competition needed to materialize the fair prices it was meant to provide. We will buy back enough shares to hold a majority of these companies. It's not an option to allow our most vulnerable people go without affordable rail and telecom."
 JAP_wealth_taxation: "Reorganized Taxation System"
 JAP_wealth_taxation_desc: "The second phase of reacquiring public services is a complete redraft of the taxation system. We have to change how we interact with corporations to cover the cost of reacquiring public services. This will be a difficult road and will harm corporate productivity, but merely trying to grow our way out of debt has not worked for a decade. It's time for a new approach."
 JAP_nationalise_infrastructure: "Nationalize Major Industries"
 JAP_nationalise_infrastructure_desc: "The ultimate goal of state ownership is the central control of all critical infrastructure. This includes transportation networks, telecom, air and sea terminals, resource extraction, and power generation, to name a few. All of these, when managed like a business, can be profitable. Stability is more important than profitability in the 21st century."
 JAP_green_investment: "Payment for Ecosystem Services"
 JAP_green_investment_desc: "State control over infrastructure is a mire of expenses and bureaucracy we do not want to commit to. Instead, our control should nudge infrastructure, resource extraction, and power generation towards sustainable solutions through incentives and subsidies. Ultimately, we hope to see a careful evolution of the economy, not a revolution."
 JAP_redundant: "Redundant Sustainability"
 JAP_redundant_desc: "Japan's vulnerability to natural disasters means that it is also vulnerable to disruptions to the global supply chain. Evolutions in renewable energy will help reduce dependency on unreliable fossil fuels as well as expensive nuclear expansions, as well as protecting our infrastructure through redundant power systems."
 JAP_e_japan: "e-Japan"
 JAP_e_japan_desc: "Interaction with bureaucracy should be as easy as possible. Renewing documents, applying and paying for titles and permits, and submitting claims should be instant and easy for all citizens. To do this, we must expand internet bandwidth and coverage. Even quiet, traditional mountain villages will soon have wireless service."
 JAP_abolish_privilege: "Bureaucratic Privilege Assessment"
 JAP_abolish_privilege_desc: "Some state employees, such as Diet representatives, enjoy special privileges that, in addition to being controversial, are taxing on the budget. Special rent prices, free travel, an excessive allowance on top of their salary. These must be evaluated and adjusted to what is actually necessary to do their job."
 JAP_cut_off_salary: "Cut Bureaucrats' Salary"
 JAP_cut_off_salary_desc: "We cannot afford to cut any more public services, for the sake of our peoples' well being. Instead, now that we have an effective measure to prevent corruption, we will reduce the excessive salaries that many bureaucrats enjoy. With strong corruption oversight in place, there is little fear of any opportunists trying to make up the difference."
 JAP_bureaucracy_amendment: "Bureaucratic Reform Amendment"
 JAP_bureaucracy_amendment_desc: "New agencies and services added to the budget will require the Diet to come to a fiscal concensus, first. This will create a barrier to new spending that encourages reform over addition. This will increase the trust in our level of taxation, rather than cutting it further."
 JAP_concessional_water_business: "Utilities Privatization"
 JAP_concessional_water_business_desc: "We will go further than just the postal services. Introducing competition to utilities, like water collection and processing, will help provide better service and maintenance to the aging infrastructure that supports it. This will ultimately provide better prices to customers, once factored into the tax relief they will receive."
 JAP_tourism_and_casino: "Tourism and Casino Business"
 JAP_tourism_and_casino_desc: "Gambling in most forms is illegal in Japan. Though this is a socially responsible measure, it means that a lucrative market for tourism is totally closed off. Worse, it encourages illegal gambling, enriching criminal organizations. Legalizing and regulating the gambling market will bring in more revenue, as well as fight crime."
 JAP_private_social_securities: "Social Securities Privatization"
 JAP_private_social_securities_desc: "Complete privatization of social services will require comprehensive reform of the private pensions market. Aside from creating a special company from the Social Insurance Agency, the first step is to open up options for those who want to opt out of the National Pension. This will be expensive at first, but we will save our citizens massive amounts in taxation in the long term."
 JAP_2nd_government_reform: "Second Central Government Reform"
 JAP_2nd_government_reform_desc: "Creating greater transparency and accountability in our bureaucratic system has helped, but we are left with a tangle of laws that are redundant- and, in some cases, full of loopholes. A second wave of legislation and reform will revitalize our bureaucatic system, reducing costs and trimming unnecessary staffing."
 JAP_anti_revolving: "Destroy Amakudari"
 JAP_anti_revolving_desc: "Amakudari (\"Descent from Heaven\") is the Japanese name for the revolving door phenomenon in politics. Bureaucrats and politicians entering the private sector invites corruption unless we control it, but we also don't want to leave those workers without a job."
 JAP_government_safeguard: "To Safeguard"
 JAP_government_safeguard_desc: "Government's role is to secure, not provide. We will protect businesses from threats they could not anticipate, but we will not coddle them and reward them for failing to plan ahead. Business shall not guide the hand of policy."
 JAP_legislated_revolving: "Reinterpret Amakudari"
 JAP_legislated_revolving_desc: "Bureaucratic cooperation with business is dangerous, but not itself harmful. Danger can be mitigated with regulation and control over business to moderate how much influence it has in politics. We can then reap the benefits of efficient coordination between public services and private needs."
 JAP_government_enrich: "To Enrich"
 JAP_government_enrich_desc: "Government's role is to enrich. This extends to business, as well. To do this, we will reinvest corporate taxes back into businesses according to policy agreed upon by both public and private companies and moderated by union leaders. The boundary between public and private is blurred in the 21st century, and we will embrace it!"

 #EDUCATION AND IDEOLOGY
 #----------------------------------------------------------------
 JAP_mil_sunrise: "Millennium Sunrise"
 JAP_mil_sunrise_desc: "Media, technology, and education are all part of the vastly expanding information spectrum that developed nations depend on. In order to recapture Japan's place at the forefront of the world's research and development, we must reinvigorate all three of these fields out of the scars of the 20th century."
 JAP_dissolve_kisha_club: "Kisha Club Reform"
 JAP_dissolve_kisha_club_desc: "Press clubs are intended to ensure that accredited journalists have easy, immediate access to information direct from sources in companies and the government. In reality, the kisha clubs of Japan shake hands and exchange favors with the entities they are supposed to keep watch over. We need to regulate and diminish the exclusive nature of these associations."
 JAP_domestic_journalism: "Domestic Media Freedom"
 JAP_domestic_journalism_desc: "Large media companies dominate the information space in Japan. Freelancers and small outlets have a difficult time getting access to information before it becomes monopolized by large media conglomerates. After regulating the kisha clubs, we must now go after institutional favoritism."
 JAP_journalism_solidarity: "Press Freedom Goal"
 JAP_journalism_solidarity_desc: "Ultimately, the goal of press freedom is to nurture a responsible, stable society that can adapt and police itself, regardless of ideology or outlook. We will commit to removing obstructive laws, monetary obstacles, and ultimately tear down the culture of silence that domestic reporters are compelled to submit to."
 JAP_alpha_influencer: "Cultivate Internet Influence"
 JAP_alpha_influencer_desc: "The rise of internet platforms like bloggers and \"Youtubers\" is a serious challenge to conventional media- and, by extension, the stability of information reaching ordinary people. This is the future of information, and we should invest in building a presence for national media on these platforms now."
 JAP_global_journalism: "Global Internet Presence"
 JAP_global_journalism_desc: "Other countries wield national media as a powerful tool for international influence. Classic giants like the BBC and newer contenders like Al-Jazeera have the eyes and ears and- most importantly- minds of millions who live beyond their home country's borders. Japan must seize this emergent form of soft power by expanding funding for NHK-World from a TV channel to a multimedia giant."
 JAP_cultural_export: "Digital Cultural Export"
 JAP_cultural_export_desc: "To many foreigners, Japanese culture is the image of East Asia. This demand for Japanese cars, Japanese noodles, Japanese beer also exports our cultural influence. The internet is no different: we will export Japanese media websites, multilingual animation, and digital concerts. With these, millions around the world will become invested in Japan as an idea."

 JAP_e_commerce_ease: "Ease of Entry"
 JAP_e_commerce_ease_desc: "Deregulating domain hosting will have several tradeoffs. Small businesses, shops, and stands will be able to advertise and sell their brand online, but this also means that illicit businesses will enjoy the same ease of access. Citizens will have a forum to speak freely, but foreign actors will also be able to pose as nationals and foment discord."
 JAP_parallel_internet_society: "Parallel Society"
 JAP_parallel_internet_society_desc: "The simple fact is that the internet is a social ecosystem outside of traditional society, and it is a waste of resources to try to force it to conform. We will establish several laws that protect unconventional commentary and anonymity on the internet- in all of its strange, esoteric forms."
 JAP_flexible_copyright: "Adaptive Copyright"
 JAP_flexible_copyright_desc: "Japanese copyright law is extremely strict and, in some ways, unsuited for the internet age. As an example, under current law, there is no provision for a \"fair use\" of material for criticism or discussion. Providing this, among other concessions, would encourage organizations as well as ordinary citizens to draw attention to issues in media."
 JAP_freedom_of_internet: "The Free Internet"
 JAP_freedom_of_internet_desc: "The internet is a tool- dangerous in some ways, but it also offers great opportunity to enrich society. Trying to pin down and proof the internet against abuse is an exercise in futility- instead, we should embrace the potential the internet has to inspire individuals to create, innovate, and share."
 JAP_e_commerce_strict: "Regulated Domain Hosting"
 JAP_e_commerce_strict_desc: "Unscrupulous domain hosts rarely care about the legitimacy of companies and individuals they provide service to. This makes it so that an illicit website can start up, direct unsuspecting users to fraudulent services, and then disappear before the operators can be prosecuted. Holding domain hosts accountable puts responsibility on them to moderate their services."
 JAP_control_internet_society: "Part of Society"
 JAP_control_internet_society_desc: "Strange, deviant subcultures congregate on internet forums and use tools like Tor or VPNs to conceal their identity, and then use this anonymity to defame and harass people. Some of these forums embrace distasteful comparisons to terrorist cults like Aum Shinrikyo. There is a limit to what civilized society can tolerate, and these cultures are well past it. We will restrict the extent to which online anonymity may exist."
 JAP_strict_copyright: "Strict Copyright"
 JAP_strict_copyright_desc: "Copyright is, in practice, binary. A holder either owns the rights to their work or they own nothing. Intellectual property is a serious issue in the 21st century, not only for domestic concerns but international patent theft as well. If we are not strict in enforcing copyright law, then it will be abused."
 JAP_national_network: "Integrated Inter-Network"
 JAP_national_network_desc: "The internet is a tool- one of great opportunity, but also one of extreme danger. We must treat it like any other territorial domain: as a critical area of Japan's national security. The average domestic user will hardly notice any change, but criminals, terrorists, and foreign agents will be foiled by a comprehensive national subnet."

 JAP_new_generation: "A New Generation"
 JAP_new_generation_desc: "The world is changing, and Japan must change with it if its people are to thrive. Whether the Western-aligned principles are correct or if Japan must take a new trajectory is unclear, but we must open our culture up to the possibility of change, or change will tear apart our inflexibility."
 JAP_new_generation_TT: "\n§GThis path will make it easier to change Japan's political outlook!§!"
 JAP_counter_tiger_mothers: "Combat the Kyōiku Mama"
 JAP_counter_tiger_mothers_desc: "\"Tiger Parents\" who put unrealistic expectations on their children are a symptom of a narrowing society, where success is only recognized by the pinnacle of achievement. This unrealistic expectation placed on youths in a stagnant market is destroying an entire generation. We do not want to be like Korea or China, so we must encourage the middle-achievers."
 JAP_dori_edu: "Dōri Principle"
 JAP_dori_edu_desc: "The time of ducking one's head and accepting irrationality is over. If Japan is to advance into the 21st century, it must have talented and driven youths that are willing to speak when their heart questions why something nonsensical is holding back progress."
 JAP_evolving_conservatism: "Evolving Conservatism"
 JAP_evolving_conservatism_desc: "Japan is changing, whether the old generation likes it or not. If we are to control the manner in which Japan changes, we must seize the hearts of the next generation. Stubbornly digging our heels and looking to the past for answers has failed to inspire the last generation of families and students, we will not make the same mistake."
 JAP_evolving_conservatism_TT: "\n§GThis path will make Japan's conservative parties more popular!§!"
 JAP_jiko_sekinin: "Jiko-Sekinin Theory"
 JAP_jiko_sekinin_desc: "Coming off of the Lost Decade's impact on society, the idea of \"Self-Responsibility\" must adapt to consider those who fell on hard times at no fault of their own. We need to motivate youths who fear they will be part of the next Lost Generation by sharing some of that responsibility as a society."
 JAP_new_dotoku: "Dōtoku Principle"
 JAP_new_dotoku_desc: "Times change, the world evolves, governments fall, but the heritage of Japan stands above time. The Dōtoku, or moral education, of youth must teach them to honor integrity in themselves and in society. An expectation of moral behavior must come from within, not outside."
 JAP_reflection: "Textbook of Reflection"
 JAP_reflection_desc: "The wounds between Japan and its Asian neighbors are not points of shame to avoid confronting. They can be a point of healing that can bind our nations together, so long as we are willing to reflect on our role and accept that we are better now than we were then."
 JAP_reflection_TT: "\n§GThis path will open diplomatic channels with more Asian countries!§! Take this if you want to interact more with other countries."
 JAP_reaching_out: "Reaching Out"
 JAP_reaching_out_desc: "Japan has a reputation of waiting for others to concede a point first before offering a concession in turn. This cannot persist in our cultural ties any longer- we must show that we are willing to make ourselves vulnerable."
 JAP_historical_apology: "A Final Apology"
 JAP_historical_apology_desc: "The details are unimportant, and that's what the Chinese and Koreans want us to accept. Arguing over the specifics of our crimes shows that our interests lie more with ourselves than those we hurt. We will make every attempt to show how we have changed."
 JAP_beacon_democracy: "Asia's Torch"
 JAP_beacon_democracy_desc: "Korea struggles on and off with authoritarian rule, Vietnam still bears scars of its civil war, Thailand and Myanmar are wracked by coups and changes in government. We are in a unique position to lead by example and guide Asia towards lasting stability."
 JAP_beacon_democracy_TT: "\n§GFuture attempts to lead Asian diplomacy will be more successful!§!"
 JAP_distance: "Textbook of Distance"
 JAP_distance_desc: "Japan's past history with other Asian countries is regrettable and tragic, but we should not follow Germany's example of self humiliation, as we are not Germans. We must study our past clinically and with somber distance, so that our youth may grow up able to think critically rather than emotionally."
 JAP_distance_TT: "\n§GThis path will improve Japan's internal stability!§! Take this if you are uninterested in foreign entanglement."
 JAP_strengthen_ties: "Strengthen Ties"
 JAP_strengthen_ties_desc: "It is fruitless to prostrate ourselves before the Communist Chinese and the Koreans, trying to placate their insatiable desire to humiliate and overtake Japan. Rather, we should reach out to those Asians who view us favorably. The Taiwanese and Indonesians, despite our history, today see us as a positive influence. We should embrace them."
 JAP_affirm_responsibility: "Affirm Our Responsibility"
 JAP_affirm_responsibility_desc: "We have already apologized for crimes that the Chinese and Koreans have demanded we humiliate ourselves further over. It is time for us to move on and memoralize our guilt for the final time, even if others refuse to accept it."
 JAP_kizuna: "Kizuna"
 JAP_kizuna_desc: "More than anything, the cultural cold war has shown us the importance of reinforcing the kizuna- the bonds- that we have, rather than failing to make new ones. Our friends overseas are important- we will make sure they feel loved as they love us."

 JAP_k_computer: "Supercomputing Developments"
 JAP_k_computer_desc: "Japan's achievements in high performance computing obviously demonstrate our technical ability to the world, but they also serve practical purposes. Supercomputers can be used to process incredibly complex simulations that a traditional computer would take years to produce results for. Retaking our place as the leading supercomputing power is paramount to our research efforts."
 JAP_interdiscipline_science: "Interdisciplinary Science"
 JAP_interdiscipline_science_desc: "Scientific advances are valuable beyond a monetary return on investment. When scientists and their students are given grants to iterate their research uninterrupted, they are more concerned with finding out the answer rather than the next profitable exchange on an R&D contract."
 JAP_commercialism_science: "Commercialized Science"
 JAP_commercialism_science_desc: "Recklessly handing out grants without any foresight is an inefficient and wasteful way to guide research. Using national research laboratories to accept private R&D contracts focuses research on what is most in need of attention to society."
 JAP_selection_and_concentration: "Selection and Concentration"
 JAP_selection_and_concentration_desc: "As part of our national laboratory reform, we need to decide how to move forward with our research funding policies. Dumping money into our laboratories is sure to bring results, but also great expenses. Some are suggesting we optimize what our research grants, instead."
 JAP_humanities: "Earthquake Studies Program"
 JAP_humanities_desc: "There is a strong interest from both the public and private sector in furthering advances in earthquake-resistant construction. If we help coordinate this research, we can overcome the geological complications with living on our seismically active home islands."
 JAP_humanities_TT: "\n§YDepending on our choice of research funding, we will receive different rewards for§! §Gconstruction technology.§!\n\n§GLean funding will provide a modest bonus for no cost!§!\n§YOptimal funding will provide a decent bonus for a small cost.§!\n§OHeavy funding will provide the same bonus as optimal but at a higher cost.§!"
 JAP_protect_faculty: "Technical University Grants"
 JAP_protect_faculty_desc: "Software is a booming market, and advances in technology are changing the way that software interfaces with the physical world. AI, 3D printing, and wireless communications are rewriting the rules of production at scale. We need to help organize these advances towards an objective."
 JAP_protect_faculty_TT: "\n§YDepending on our choice of research funding, this focus will have different costs.\n\n§GLean funding will give us a small amount of political power!§!\n§YOptimal funding will cost us $$10B.§!\n§OHeavy funding will cost us $$30B.§!"
 JAP_protect_academism: "Social Sciences in Government"
 JAP_protect_academism_desc: "Okinawa- or, more appropriately, the Ryukyu Islands that it is a part of- has a latent independence movement. Though it has waned in popularity in recent years, it is a source of instability in Okinawa Prefecture. Studies and surveys of the population will help us insulate the effects of this instability."
 JAP_nation_of_science: "Genetic Science Advances"
 JAP_nation_of_science_desc: "Genome sequencing has leaped forward in sophistication over the past decades, bringing huge health and science benefits. Owed in part to this, life expectancy is trending upwards- we must take advantage of this if we are to keep our aging society healthy and productive."
 JAP_nation_of_science_TT: "\n§YDepending on our choice of research funding, we will receive different rewards for§! §Ggene sequencing technology.§!\n\n§GLean funding will provide a modest bonus for no cost!§!\n§YOptimal funding will provide a decent bonus for a small cost.§!\n§OHeavy funding will provide the same bonus as optimal but at a higher cost.§!"
 JAP_reorganise_universities: "Space Technologies"
 JAP_reorganise_universities_desc: "Industry-Academia-Government: these three bodies form a triple helix of coordinated development towards solving practical and theoretical problems. This can only be realized through streamlining communication and strengthening oversight in order to eliminate the wasteful allocation of funds- both public and private."
 JAP_reorganise_universities_TT: "\n§YDepending on our choice of research funding, this focus will have different costs.\n\n§GLean funding will give us a small amount of political power!§!\n§YOptimal funding will cost us $$10B.§!\n§OHeavy funding will cost us $$30B.§!"
 JAP_san_gaku_kan: "Form JAXA"
 JAP_san_gaku_kan_desc: "After a period of dormancy following the Lost Decade, it is time to revitalize our space technology. We will reorganize our existing space organizations into a unified agency. The new Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency will be the primary avenue for helping us expand our satellite constellations."
 JAP_reboot_sigma: "Reboot SIGMA"
 JAP_reboot_sigma_desc: "The Sigma Project was an ultimately failed attempt to standardize software development architecture during the 80s. In reality, it created a software ecosystem that lagged behind the rest of the world, just like the Soviets' attempt. We will change our approach: embrace the world's modern software design philosophies and overtake them with quality."

 JAP_djibouti_base_desc: "For years now, pirates in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea area have been terrorizing merchant ships flying our flags, something needs to be done about it.

 JAP_defense_spending: "Defense Spending Adjustment"
 JAP_defense_spending_desc: "Historically, Japan has pursued a non-binding policy of limiting Japan's defense budget to 1% of the GDP.Though perhaps shortsighted, its impact on the question of defense spending in peacetime informs policymaking even today, with vocal political pressure to keep the defense budget slim."

 JAP_reserve_pilots: "Reserve Pilots?"
 JAP_reserve_pilots_desc: "The JASDF's reservist roster is extremely small, numbering only a few thousand personnel. We should evaluate our air reservist program and consider what to do with it."
 JAP_plane_procurement: "Finish F-2 Procurement"
 JAP_plane_procurement_desc: "The F-2 program has been a complicated and difficult ordeal. Though it has produced an excellent airplane, it is an expensive one, we must determine if we should maintain the original order or reduce the target deliveries."
 JAP_air_emphasis: "Next-Gen Aircraft Contracts"
 JAP_air_emphasis_desc: "With the F-2's lessons in mind, we must plot the course for our next generation of aircraft designs well before we begin designing them. The requirements will need to be exhaustive."
 JAP_jgsdf_org: "Organization of the JGSDF"
 JAP_jgsdf_org_desc: "Our ground forces have an unremarkable reputation and dreadful recruitment numbers, in part due to the training they receive as well as having an unclear mission. This millennium will begin with focused wargames to deal with the former."
 JAP_army_flexibility: "Flexibility or Specialty?"
 JAP_army_flexibility_desc: "The JSDF is trained as a defense force- though this has been conceived as defending against aggressive state actors, the public has a perception that its only purpose is war. It's time to review the ground forces' mission and determine what it is meant to be."

 JAP_tank_procurement_desc: "Japan's tank force is small, but potent, thanks to the recently adopted Kyū maru shiki. Though an excellent, modern tank, further production of the Type 90 may be a burden on the budget. What does the future hold for the Main Battle Tank?"
 JAP_army_emphasis: "Future Defense Official"
 JAP_army_emphasis_desc: "The title of 'soldier' is unpopular in Japan due to the aggressive connotation it carries. As such, the preferred term is best translated as 'defense official'. With the evolving mission of the JGSDF, what will the 'defense official' of the future look like?"
 JAP_jmsdf_org: "Organization of the JMSDF"
 JAP_jmsdf_org_desc: "As an island nation, Japan depends on the Maritime Self-Defense Forces to be the first line of defense against any aggressor. Though its ships may be among the most modern in the world, the JMSDF suffers from poor recruitment and lack of training. We must address this."
 JAP_dockyard_leasing: "Shipyard Foreign Leasing"
 JAP_dockyard_leasing_desc: "After the war, Japan turned over what remained of its shipyard facilities to private industry, which remains the status quo today. While these shipyards are contracted to build JMSDF vessels, they could also be permitted to build vessels for other countries, too... if we revise our laws."
 JAP_navy_procurement: "Vessel Contracts"

It was suited to the Japan's peaceful constitution and sometimes was refered as the worldwide objective for global peace in the Cold War era. However some nation, especiall the economic and military power, in the Western or the Eastern or the Emerging, are trying to ignore as an unrealistic fantasy, and doing to go a nuclear development and its test. In fact, the United States, the good ally of Japan, was installed the launching site of nuclear missiles in Occupied Okinawa, and often brings into Japan as a red button only for the President. And as a fun fact, this principles have not included the management or researching of the nuclear power and its peaceful uses like a power plant."

Russia, on the other hand, asserts sovereignty over the islands and maintains effective control.\n\n§YTakeshima (Korean name: Dokdo)§!: Located in the Sea of Japan (East Sea), this island is claimed by Japan but has been under effective control by South Korea since the 1950s. The dispute remains a highly contentious issue between the two countries, involving historical interpretations and fishing rights, and is considered politically sensitive.\n\n§YSenkaku Islands (Chinese name: Diaoyu Islands)§!: This group of uninhabited islets in the East China Sea has been under Japan’s effective control since 1895, but is also claimed by China and Taiwan (Republic of China). Since the 1990s, repeated diplomatic protests and competing assertions have made the issue a potential flashpoint for future tensions.\n\nAll of these disputes are deeply intertwined with history, international law, effective control, diplomatic relations, and domestic public opinion.

 #JAP Demographics Crisis
 #----------------------------------------------------------------
 Japan_Demographic.100000100.t: "The Setting Sun"
 Japan_Demographic.100000100.d: "Japan's future is in peril. As a result of shrinking growth, a drought of business opportunities is pushing startups toward the already limited office space in Tokyo. Chasing this opportunity, educated young adults have begun to flee their stagnating cities and compete for increasingly cramped apartment space and jobs that impose staggering workloads on a limited workforce.\n\nFor similar reasons, families have become fewer and fewer in the last decade. Young adults are breaking under the pressure to find a job in this environment, and elderly workers are retiring faster than new workers are able or willing to replace them.\n\nThe Shūken, or Centralization, of business opportunities towards Tokyo will strangle our growth. Simultaneously, the Kaso, or Depopulation, is preventing businesses from filling positions.\n\nThese two issues will get worse every §Ytwo years§! until we reach a significant level of reform in each area. The these effects will become more severe after §Rfour years§!."
 Japan_Demographic.100000100.oA: "The sun will rise once more."
 #Demographics Promises Mini-Chain
 Japan_Demographic.100000101.t: "Opportunity Amidst Crisis"
 Japan_Demographic.100000101.d: "We must decide what our public policy leading up to this election should be. The Liberal Democratic Party's current coalition is under stress, and there is the threat that the party may need to stand on its own own very soon. The issue over demographics is becoming more prevalent in public discussion, and a clear program for tackling this is necessary.\n\nConservative voices, such as those supporting our coalition in the Komeito party, are urging us to spend more money on supporting families, even if it pushes the national debt higher. This would certainly cement our position as the leading conservative party and give us power to push the smaller parties around, even if our coalition ends.\n\nOn the other hand, in order to suck momentum out of the opposition's campaign, we could court undecided progressives by paying lip service to foreign worker's issues and touch on labor reform. This could be highly dangerous, however, if we do not keep their demands under control by ensuring we also soon pass legislation to §YProtect Workers' Rights§!."
 Japan_Demographic.100000101.oA: "Increase subsidies for families."
 Japan_Demographic.100000101.oB: "Bring attention to workers' issues."
 Japan_Demographic.100000102.t: "Conservative Base Demand More From [This.GetRulingParty]!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000102.d: "Though we have benefitted from our efforts to improve support for families, this has not been without consequence. Our social security experiments have been well received, but the associated tax overhead has not been so warmly regarded. Businesses are begging us to balance our budget with a smaller tax rate.\n\nIf we acquiesce, we may have to swallow one or more bitter pills- accept taking on more debt while we reorganize the budget, cutting other expenditures, or using our political clout to fight for the return of the existing tax rate."
 Japan_Demographic.100000102.oA: "We will make do with less."
 Japan_Demographic.100000102.oB: "Oh, stuff it!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000103.t: "Progressive Base Demand More From [This.GetRulingParty]!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000103.d: "Talking about workers' issues in the Diet has had the desired effect of robbing voters from the Democratic Party of Japan and Social Democratic Party, but this has shaken the foundation of Japanese politics. Some of the major trade union conglomerates that have traditionally only supported the opposition have recently spoken favorably about us, and are suggesting close association if we promise to support several key points they have drafted together.\n\nThis uncomfortably intimate display of support coincides with the withdrawal of campaign funds from major corporations and industrial conglomerates that [This.GetRulingParty] has traditionally depended on.\n\nWhat should we do? Is it took late to reverse course?"
 Japan_Demographic.100000103.oA: "Get Mitsubishi on the phone! Apologize!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000103.oB: "Well, we can't exactly backpedal now, can we?"
 #First Reminder
 Japan_Demographic.100000203.t: "Looming Depopulation Consequences"
 Japan_Demographic.100000203.d: "Only a year has passed since our evaluation of the demographic crisis looming over Japan. Though we have made progress in handling the centralization of growth towards Kanto, we are seeing frightening consequences for our workforce developing, and the public is taking notice of the effects of this.\n\nBusinesses are struggling to fill positions, and students are dropping out in record numbers. Elderly people forced into retirement due to their age are taking their own lives to avoid becoming a burden to their loved ones.\n\nWe can, at the very least, alleviate some of these issues by committing to a §GWelfare State§! or §GExtensive Welfare State§!, but we must maintain this level of social support until we see the effects of our efforts sometime during the coming year.\n\nIn the meantime, we need to make a statement about this situation, but more urgently we need to advance our reform in the handling the depopulation crisis, even a little, before we lose control of the situation!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000203.oA: "Reiterate our promises that things will improve with time."
 Japan_Demographic.100000203.oB: "Commit to increasing our social support."
 Japan_Demographic.100000203.oC: "The opposition attacks our response..."
 Japan_Demographic.100000205.t: "Positive Effect From Reforms"
 Japan_Demographic.100000205.d: "Only a year has passed since our evaluation of the demographic crisis looming over Japan. Fortunately, the effort we have put into our reforms in both the issues of depopulation and centralization have had a positive effect on the overall demographic crisis.\n\nThough Tokyo's overcrowding issue is still present, we have slowed the flight of business and workers towards the stressed metropolis. Additionally, people are becoming more comfortable with family subsidies and revisions to labor reforms, even if the change is a stressful period of adjustment.\n\nAll we need to do for the next year is stay the course, and we should have a good effect when we next evaluate our progress. We will need to continue our reforms for the following biannual review, but we can firmly say we are on the right track.\n\nFor the moment, all we need to do is concern ourselves with the spoils of our efforts: shall we have a speech to cement our position, or let the opposition struggle to think of something to say in our place?"
 Japan_Demographic.100000205.oA: "Hold a speech in the Diet."
 Japan_Demographic.100000205.oB: "Allow the opposition to embarrass themselves!"
 #Demographics First Checkup
 Japan_Demographic.100000300.t: "Summary of Demographic Crisis - [GetYear]"
 Japan_Demographic.100000300.d: "Enough time has passed for the consequences of the demographic crisis to become apparent to our analysts- as well as the general public. Media coverage of our attempts to reform our handling of the crisis is appearing, both through sponsored sources like NHK but also gaining traction through online blogs and message boards.\n\nUntil recently, no concensus of our performance has been reached, but as the effects of the demographics issue become clearer we can see a trend developing in how the public recognizes our handling of the issue."
 Japan_Demographic.100000300.oA: "Let's hope we have done enough..."
 Japan_Demographic.100000321.t: "Big Depopulation Problems Surface!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000321.d: "Our efforts to help alleviate the depopulation crisis have shown to be ineffective. In fact, the situation has gotten worse ahead of even our most pessimistic projections. We must catch up significantly with our reform, or we can expect the situation to get even worse in the next two years.\n\nCertain §Yeconomic and labor§! focuses can §Gadvance our reform.§!"

 Japan_Demographic.100000322.t: "Ominous Depopulation Issues"
 Japan_Demographic.100000322.d: "We have managed to control the depopulation issue for the immediate future, but there are still significant issues that are causing uncertainty in the public. We must continue advancing our reform, or we can expect the situation to slip out of our control over the next two years.\n\nIn the meantime, an oversight in our reform has left us with §R$30B§! in unpaid family incentives. Although embarrassing, we don't need to pay this out, but it would hurt our image if we ignore this."
 Japan_Demographic.100000322.oA: "Pay out our promised incentives."
 Japan_Demographic.100000322.oB: "Pay out, but also promise more."
 Japan_Demographic.100000322.oC: "It was a mistake, so we shouldn't pay more than we agreed."
 Japan_Demographic.100000323.t: "Easing Depopulation Concerns"
 Japan_Demographic.100000323.d: "Numbers for employment are up, incidents of death by overwork are down. We're doing well, by any standard, and the public supports our policies. We need to continue our reform before can claim to truly have the situation under control, but this is a good start.\n\nSince our current level of reform has outpaced our needs, this has given us a bit of room to adjust our budget if we wish to."
 Japan_Demographic.100000323.oA: "Stay the course."
 Japan_Demographic.100000323.oB: "Reallocate the budget for more social spending."
 Japan_Demographic.100000323.oC: "Amend the budget to lower taxes."

 Japan_Demographic.100000403.t: "Looming Depopulation Consequences"
 Japan_Demographic.100000403.d: "The public is becoming restless about serious issues stemming from the depopulation crisis. Avoidable deaths are on the rise, young people are despondent and the elderly have nowhere to turn to. People are pessimistic that our reforms are having any effect in turning the situation around, and our analysts agree that the situation will get worse if we do not §Gadvance our reform§! further.\n\nIn the meantime, we need to provide a public response to this issue.\n\nMaintaning a §GWelfare State§! or §GExtensive Welfare State§! will provide a bonus to our reform efforts, but this alone is not enough.

 Japan_Demographic.100000403.oA: "Reiterate our promises that things will improve with time."
 Japan_Demographic.100000403.oB: "Commit to increasing our social support."

 Japan_Demographic.100000405.t: "Positive Effect From Reforms"
 Japan_Demographic.100000405.d: "All reports indicate that our reforms have reached a level of success that all but ensures that we will see both our Centralization and Depopulation issues improve over time. Businesses are moving back to other large cities and bringing workers with them, and our rail companies are reporting a positive trend in revenue over the past 12 months.\n\nSo long as we maintain our current level of §Gsocial spending§!, we anticipate a growth in families and a reduction in unnecessary deaths, both by overwork as well as by destitution.\n\nIt has been a hard road to get this point, but we can confidently say that we have overcome the worst, and we just need to monitor the effect our reform has until, hopefully, the demographic crisis is resolved for good."
 Japan_Demographic.100000405.oA: "Hold a speech in the Diet."
 Japan_Demographic.100000405.oB: "Allow the opposition to embarrass themselves!"
 #Demographics Main Sequence Checkup
 Japan_Demographic.100000500.t: "Summary of Demographic Crisis - [GetYear]"
 Japan_Demographic.100000500.d: "Enough time has passed for the consequences of the demographic crisis to become apparent to our analysts- as well as the general public. Media coverage of our attempts to reform our handling of the crisis is appearing, both through sponsored sources like NHK but also gaining traction through online blogs and message boards.\n\nUntil recently, no concensus of our performance has been reached, but as the effects of the demographics issue become clearer we can see a trend developing in how the public recognizes our handling of the issue."
 Japan_Demographic.100000500.oA: "Let's hope we have done enough..."
 Japan_Demographic.100000521.t: "Pension Scandal!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000521.d: "Trust in our social reforms has been badly shaken by an incident in which multiple Diet members have been accused of pension payment evasion. The point of this reform was to ensure that all citizens are contributing their pension payments fairly, and it has successfully uncovered a systemic void in necessary payments. Unfortunately, this gap is from the ledgers of multiple Diet members, including many in our party.\n\nEven though we had hoped this accountability reform would improve public confidence in our social programs, this ugly revelation has convinced many that any government operated pension system will be riddled with corruption. We must continue to reform how we handle the Depopulation issue in spite of this, or this will simply happen on a larger scale again."
 Japan_Demographic.100000521.oA: "A disgrace..."
 Japan_Demographic.100000521.oB: "Kick the offenders out of our party!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000521.oC: "Set up an investigation commission!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000522.t: "Depopulation Crisis Worsens!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000522.d: "Families are still on the decline, increasing the pace at which our workforce is depleting. Many citizens, young and old, feel they have nowhere to turn to, even with the reforms we have tried to introduce. There is simply not enough progress done to tie together our efforts in a way that has reached the average person who is suffering under this crisis.\n\nAdditional reform will start to reverse the situation."
 Japan_Demographic.100000522.oA: "We must act now, before it gets worse!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000523.t: "Depopulation Crisis Improves!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000523.d: "Birth rates are up, people are feeling more comfortable relying on social services, and the dark cloud of overwork, unemployment, and hopelessness is lifting from Japan. We are even beginning to pull ahead of other Asian countries that are suffering from declining birthrates.\n\nSo long as we retain this level of social spending, we can be reasonably sure that things will continue to improve over the next few years. Any further effort advancing our reform may ease our need to lean on our social spending, but otherwise is no longer necessary to continue this trend."
 Japan_Demographic.100000523.oA: "Great!"
 #Demographics Resolution
 Japan_Demographic.100000602.t: "Depopulation Crisis Reform Complete"
 Japan_Demographic.100000602.d: "Finally, the worst of the depopulation crisis is behind us. There is little more we can do to further improve the last remaining issues without also bringing the centralization crisis under control. Once we have done that, we can draft policies that can combine the administrative systems for the centralization and depopulation systems, and optimize them to take advantage of the framework we have created!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000602.oA: "Great!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000602.oB: "Optimize and combine our reform policies!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000603.t: "Demographics Reform Unified!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000603.d: "We've done it! Many naysayers abroad had considered Japan's future bleak, but we have silenced them all with our many years of hard work. Through careful analysis and administration of our reform policies, we have optimized our social subsidies and urban planning beyond what other countries have been able to replicate.\n\nTourism is booming in clean, beautiful cities all across Japan, and our new Shinkansen rolling stock are faster, larger, and more comfortable than ever before- slashing commuter traffic. Businesses are reporting record numbers of filled positions, and those that are unable to find work feel confident in our advanced social service system, which has become the shining star of Asian welfare."

 Japan.100001001.t: "The Issue of Union Seats"
 Japan.100001001.d: "We have committed our reform to reserving seats in the Diet for elected trade union representatives, but we must decide how much influence we actually want to give them. Since we have already satisfied the unions with this move, there is no risk of agitating them if we keep the number of seats reserved for them modest and unlikely to shake up an election.\n\nHowever, if we are confident we can leverage the unions' influence in our favor, it may be worth providing for more seats than we initially offered."
 Japan.100001001.oA: "A token amount."
 Japan.100001001.oB: "They cannot be ignored."
 Japan.100002000.t: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] Offers a Samurai Bond Deal"
 Japan.100002000.d: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] is interested in offering us an investment deal in order to help stimulate their domestic economy.\n\nWe will issue Yen-denominated bonds valued at $30b and these will be bought by [FROM.GetAdjectiveCap] investors to finance our interests at home. Given [FROM.GetNameWithFlag]'s exceptionally low interest rates due to their economic situation, this won't add to our national debt at all.\n\n[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] will gain a negligible amount of influence from this."
 Japan.100002000.oA: "Accept the Deal."
 Japan.100002000.oB: "Refuse the Deal."
 Japan.100002001.t: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] Accepts the Deal!"
 Japan.100002001.d: "Officials from [FROM.GetNameWithFlag] have agreed to issue a bond package worth $30b in order to finance [FROM.GetAdjectiveCap] development companies seeking investment capital. The reliable yet modest margins offered by these bonds have our domestic investors eager to take advantage of this deal, and we comfortably predict a 100% demand for the whole package!"
 Japan.100002001.oA: "Excellent."
 Japan.100002002.t: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] Refuses the Deal"
 Japan.100002002.d: "Unfortunately, officials from [FROM.GetName] have declined our offer for a bond package. This shouldn't cause any economic consequences at home, but we will miss out on the possible investment income."
 Japan.100002002.oA: "Unfortunate."
 Japan.100002100.t: "An Empress on the Throne?"
 Japan.100002100.d: "Four decades have passed with no male heir born in the Imperial Family. The debate over opening up the succession has taken many twists, with Conservative voices willing to entertain any idea- no matter how strange- to retain a male-only succesion line, as has been historical precedent. However, this is no longer a popular position that the public supports.\n\nIgnoring the fact that any male heir would inevitably find himself under immense stress later in his life, the existing stress on the children of Emperor Akihito to provide a male heir is, to many, inhumane. We must at least open the door for future possibilities for female succession."
 Japan.100002100.oA: "Just provide for the possibility."
 Japan.100002100.oB: "The callous demand for a male heir must stop."
 Japan.100002101.t: "An Empress on the Throne?"
 Japan.100002101.d: "With the birth of Prince Hisahito, the immediacy of the succession debate has been pushed back. However, the question remains strong in the Japanese public consciousness. Conservative voices want to retain a male-only succesion line, as has been historical precedent. However, this is no longer a popular position that the public supports. We must at least open the door for future possibilities for female succession.\n\nIf not for Prince Hisahito's birth, this would mean that Princess Aiko would have the next legitmate claim, following Prince Naruhito.\n\nThe real question is, with Hisahito born and a Empress on the Chrysanthemum Throne an open possibility for the future, should the youngest addition to the Imperial Family retain his position at the expense of a princess with more immediate claim to the Throne?"
 Japan.100002101.oA: "Let's not dig that up, now."
 Japan.100002101.oB: "In the interest of equality, no!"

 Japan.100003000.t: "Argument over Privatization Debate"
 Japan.100003000.d: "The Diet is bubbling with discussion over the decision to cease any further privatization of national companies. This comes at the end of much deliberation within the LDP over the fate of the postal service, and the culmination of the discussion has left the LDP split. Various parties are trying to take credit for this upset, each respectively citing their argmuents as being the decisive factor in the ultimate withdrawal from further attempts to open up what remains of the Japanese nationalised services to the free market.\n\nArguments continue, but the real question is, who caught the most attention from the public?"
 Japan.100003000.oA: "The Conservatives."
 Japan.100003000.oB: "The Liberals."
 Japan.100003000.oC: "The Socialists."
 Japan.100003000.oD: "The Nationalists."
 Japan.100003010.t: "Acreage Reduction Policy Phase-out"
 Japan.100003010.d: "Until the Food Control System was abolished in 1995, the rice market in Japan had been controlled by the government. This practice, started during the Second World War but having feudal roots, had been intended to guarantee a fixed reserve of rice as a national security measure. However, since farms would sell all of their rice to the government, they had an incentive to produce as much as possible. 'Gentan' policy refers to a range of subsidies that originated in the 70s, intended to keep prices of rice high, and thus keep the crop profitable. Essentially, it was cheaper for the government to pay farmers a subsidy to limit their acreage of planted rice crop rather than find a way to be rid of surplus rice.\n\nIt is now [GetYear], and the subsidies are a non-insignificant source of government expenditure. Without the Food Control System, maintaining Gentan policy no longer makes sense, but many large farmers depend on the high prices it artificially creates.\n\nWe need to decide how to support the farmers. Do we hand out a final wave of adjusted subsidies over the next three years? Or do we offer a predicted lump sum compensation?"
 Japan.100003010.oA: "Phase it out."
 Japan.100003010.oB: "Tear the plaster off."
 Japan.100003110.t: "Audit Finds Excess Expenditures!"
 Japan.100003110.d: "As part of our reforms to the Board of Audit, we have submitted an expense report following the new, stricter guidelines. The board has found that there are a few programs that have run over budget. Though this means we will need to authorize an extension to the budget to balance the difference, this discovery has had a positive effect on how the public sees our reform efforts. This makes the [Root.GetRulingParty] appear committed to holding itself accountable."
 Japan.100003110.oA: "Well, it's not all bad!"
 Japan.100003111.t: "Audit Finds Budget Discrepancy!"
 Japan.100003111.d: "As part of our reforms to the Board of Audit, we have submitted an expense report following the new, stricter guidelines. The board has found there is an unspent sum of finances that does not align with the total expenditures, which could indicate something suspicious. An investigation has been demanded in order to determine the cause of the discrepancy.\n\nIf something is found that implicates the opposition, we can reap the benefits, having initiated the audit reform. Of course, there is the possibility that some of our own party members could be involved in something embarrassing, as well..."
 Japan.100003111.oA: "The opposition failed to disclose campaign finances!"
 Japan.100003111.oB: "Our cabinet overpaid a subsidy!"
 Japan.100003112.t: "Audit Finds Budget On Target!"
 Japan.100003112.d: "As part of our reforms to the Board of Audit, we have submitted an expense report following the new, stricter guidelines. The board has found all of our government's expenditures line up with the budget for this year. We have succeeded in establishing greater fiscal transparency, and we can put a bit more presusre on our political partners as a consequence."
 Japan.100003112.oA: "Fantastic."
 Japan.100003200.t: "Schism in the LDP!"
 Japan.100003200.d: "Committing to continued privatization of state services has caused a fracture in the Liberal Democratic Party! Though we have seen this confrontation coming, the scale of the exodus from the party was not. A moderate amount of representatives are going over to the Democratic Party of Japan, and a few are moving away from our Western-oriented approach to globalized economics in protest, which we expected, and we have no real way to prevent that fact.\n\nHowever, a large group are debating joining a competing conservative group, the New Conservative Party. An opposing conservative block in the opposition would torpedo any chance we have of winning any elections in the future! We've devised a plan to appeal to this contingent of deserters with promises of a market-driven analysis of the private sector for the state services we're replacing, even though we already intended to do this as part of our approach. This would restrict our ability to operate as we wish for the future, though, but it's better than a vote of no confidence!"
 Japan.100003200.oA: "Wait! Keep some critical services fully owned by the state..."
 Japan.100003200.oB: "We'll win back the house without you!"
 Japan.100003400.t: "Corruption Slips Past Oversight!"
 Japan.100003400.d: "The digitization of our bureaucratic oversight committee has allowed for a significant reduction in administrative costs, but this has only been possible because of trust in the system to catch and alert the committee to suspicious actions. A scandal has broken that an official used trusted knowledge of the Digital Personnel Management database to evade automatic detection of some underhanded dealings. This has shaken confidence in the system and, until we can patch up the loopholes that allowed this, we won't see any benefits of the automation, but we will feel all of the costs!"
 Japan.100003400.oA: "Damn!"
 Japan.100003401.t: "Corruption Nailed Down!"
 Japan.100003401.d: "The technicians responsible for automating the Digital Personnel Management software have reported that the system has been updated to account for the most recent, high profile patterns of suspicious activity. We can comfortably say any future loopholes trying to slip bribery, deals, or other forms of corruption 'under the radar', so to speak, are accounted for."
 Japan.100003401.oA: "Let's hope."
 Japan.100003500.t: "The Green Atom?"
 Japan.100003500.d: "As discussions continue about reducing our fossil fuel dependency, there is a question that Japan must address. Japan's history with the atom is a scarred one, and although opposition to nuclear energy is a minority today, the debate over the future energy plan for a green Japan has brought the discussion back into the forefront.\n\nThough the nuclear energy of today is generally very safe, Japan is very seismically vulnerable. This also extends to its nuclear power stations and spent fuel cooling sites. A once in a millennium disaster could, one day, cause enough damage to cause a release of nuclear material.\n\nThe truth is, today, Japan would not be able to support its electrical grid without nuclear power. However, if we were to commit to a phase-out of our nuclear energy over the next 5 years, we could shift our research grants away from nuclear research and into more generally applicable electrical technology. This would yield huge bonuses to our overall electrical grid."
 Japan.100003500.oA: "No. We need nuclear energy. Period."
 Japan.100003500.oB: "Let's do it."

 Japan.100004000.t: "The Wounded Phoenix"
 Japan.100004000.d: "After the devastation of the Second World War, Japan not only overcame the turbulence of political instability that followed, but developed into an economic giant that even briefly overtook the United States' GDP.\n\nOf course, this didn't last. Following a period of catastrophic recession, Japan's economy may have stabilized yet its society has not. The scars of the economic crash have isolated an entire generation, and the traditional stability that Japan has taken for granted is no longer so certain. There are many politicians that have been waiting for an opening to pry open the conservative grip on Japanese politics, and there are many disenfranchised voters who will take a chance with these promises rather than let stagnation keep the helm."
 Japan.100004000.oA: "Policies change, but Japan does not."
 Japan.100004000.oB: "It's time to shake things up..."
 Japan.100004000.oC: "... a lot. We'll replace the whole system..."

 Japan.100004010.t: "Foundation of NHK World"
 Japan.100004010.d: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] has established an international channel of its public broadcasting service, NHK. This alone is not newsworthy- what is unusual is what Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is offering. Rather than solely provide NHK World as a television channel, they are eager to introduce an internet video service worldwide.\n\nThey are offering to help provide technological upgrades to our internet technology in order to support the bandwidth needed for live video service. In exchange, our internet service providers will guarantee \"zero rating\" preference for NHK World's bandwidth, which exempts the website's data usage from user's data allowances.\n\nHow should we respond?"
 Japan.100004010.oA: "Let's do it."
 Japan.100004010.oB: "Terrible idea."

 Japan.100004011.d: "As part of our negotations with [FROM.GetNameWithFlag] over the development of their internet technology, they have agreed to ensure that their ISPs will provide favorable data plans to their users accessing NHK World online.\n\nIf we wanted to take this partnership further, we could provide investments in their telecom infrastructure."

 Japan.100004011.oB: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] could use some better infrastructure, actually!"
 Japan.100004012.t: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] Provides Additional Investments"
 Japan.100004012.d: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] is pleased that we have accepted the telecom technology deal, and have invested some additional resources to help update our telecom infrastructure. This should be helpful once we finish integrating our internet technology and are ready to install the new infrastructure."
 Japan.100004012.oA: "Nice."
 Japan.100004020.t: "Patent Agreement with China?"
 Japan.100004020.d: "With us relaxing our copyright protections to better suit the digital age, there is one loophole that we must close. [CHI.GetNameWithFlag] has often ignored foreign intellectual property rights, and does little to punish patent theft by its national companies.\n\nMajor Japanese business interests have proposed that we tackle the situation directly by appealing to Chinese interests. The proposed deal is to share some of the industrial patents that the Chinese would otherwise just steal, and in exchange provide favorable deals for our industrial resource procurement, allowing us to forward some of our required production resources through Chinese subsidiaries.\n\nThis isn't without risk, however. The Chinese are fickle, and always looking for an opportunity to embarrass us- even when it means throwing out a good deal. Should we go for it?"
 Japan.100004020.oA: "Let's try it."
 Japan.100004020.oB: "A waste of time."
 Japan.100004021.t: "Sino-Japanese Patent Agreement"
 Japan.100004021.d: "[JAP.GetNameWithFlag] has approached us with an offer to try to remedy some of the conflicts we have over intellectual property rights. Up front, they want us to hold our companies responsible for patent violations that copy Japanese construction and industrial technology. In exchange, they are offering to use this agreement as a commercial line of cooperation to provide us with industrial technology.\n\nIf we accept this outright, we will undoubtedly face criticism for openly submitting to conditions for us to develop our economy, even if the deal might help us gain this technology quicker. We could instead use [JAP.GetNameWithFlag]'s willingness to see this deal concluded to pressure them to apologize for their historic war crimes... but there's the risk they may retract their cooperation if we do."
 Japan.100004021.oA: "We'll see what they can offer."
 Japan.100004021.oB: "This is an attack on our sovereignty!"
 Japan.100004021.oC: "They must sincerely apologize for the past first."
 Japan.100004022.t: "China Accepts!"
 Japan.100004022.d: "Surprisingly, [CHI.GetNameWithFlag] has agreed to cooperate with our patent protection agreement, in exchange for modest technical assistance with developing their economy. This is a great deal for us, as we can use this agreement to gain a favorable exchange on resource imports whenever scarcity might otherwise hinder our production."
 Japan.100004022.oA: "Good."
 Japan.100004023.t: "China Refuses!"
 Japan.100004023.d: "[CHI.GetNameWithFlag] has refused to cooperate with us! Despite us reaching out to them with favorable terms, they think themselves above our technical assistance. The opposition is criticizing our approach, and we are worse off than had we just not bothered to reach out to the ingrates!"
 Japan.100004023.oA: "Shameful!"
 Japan.100004024.t: "China Demands An Apology!"
 Japan.100004024.d: "The [CHI.GetFlag]Chinese have entertained our proposal, with a strong caveat... Japan has previously apologized for its war of aggression against China both to the [CHI.GetFlag]PRC and to [ROC.GetFlag]Taiwan, yet they are demanding we acknowledge their figures for the death toll of certain events... figures which we dispute the accuracy of.\n\nThis is, of course, a political move by [CHI.GetNameWithFlag], and we're now stuck in an awkward position. Do we pull out of our offer? Or is this deal worth the embarrassment of humiliating ourselves before the Chinese?"
 Japan.100004024.oA: "Hirumanai..."
 Japan.100004024.oB: "We've apologized enough already!!"
 Japan.100004025.t: "Japan Apologizes For War Crimes!"
 Japan.100004025.d: "In an unexpected turn, [JAP.GetLeader] of [JAP.GetNameWithFlag] has made a public address where [JAP.GetLeader.GetSheHe] provided a conciliatory acknowledgement of [JAP.GetNameWithFlag]'s aggression during the Sino-Japanese war. Of note, [JAP.GetLeader] made particular note of Japanese war crimes, admitting regret and offering hope for the two nations to draw closer.\n\nCuriously, and noted by several observers, for the first time [JAP.GetLeader] used the Chinese figures for the number of victims of war crimes, which have been disputed in the past."
 Japan.100004025.oA: "That easily? Okay."
 Japan.100004025.oB: "It's insincere!"
 Japan.100004026.t: "Japan Refuses to Apologize!"
 Japan.100004026.d: "In a move that surprised nobody, in [JAP.GetLeader.GetHerHis] latest press conference, [JAP.GetLeader] refused to provide any comment on Japanese atrocities during the Sino-Japanese war. This comes following their offer to involve us in a very close trade deal, which has effectively torpedoed the arrangement and agitated Chinese sentiments towards their former adversary."
 Japan.100004026.oA: "Typical."
 Japan.100004027.t: "China Refuses Anyway!"
 Japan.100004027.d: "In a shocking betrayal of good faith, [CHI.GetNameWithFlag] has refused our apology and washed their hands of our technical agreement. They have mocked our apology as insincere and used the fact they extorted it from us as another internal political game- an uncomfortably typical display from the Chinese that we should have been aware of before we trusted them with such a somber display of humility.\n\nOne thing is for sure, we know who we're dealing with, now."
 Japan.100004027.oA: "Arrogant bastards!"
 Japan.100004030.t: "Media Shakeup!"
 Japan.100004030.d: "Recent policy changes have sent shockwaves through the country, as established Japanese news companies scramble to adapt to new laws limiting how restrictive companies may be in providing press coverage to smaller news outlets. The broadening market has allowed many smaller news outlets, including independent journalists, to seize the opportunity to capitalize on stories with higher quality and more diverse coverage.\n\nThe greatest impact has yet to come, as ratings continue to plummet for the largest news conglomerates."
 Japan.100004030.oA: "As it should be."

 Japan.100004100.t: "Research Policy Reform"
 Japan.100004100.d: "As we reorganize our national research laboratories to fit the 21st century, we need to decide how to fund them.

 Japan.100006100.d: "The JSDF has a difficult mission in peacetime- how do you justify spending billions of yen on a fighting force when there is no threat? One way the Defense Forces return on their investment is through disaster relief, both domestic and regional. The logistical capacity and manpower provided by the JSDF to civilian disaster response agencies is crucial when lives are at stake.\n\nAs part of the government bureaucratic reform, since the JGSDF are especially important to domestic disaster relief, it may be appropriate to combine the Fire and Disaster Management Agency (Shōbōchō) into the Ministry of Defense, rather than the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. This would allow the Shōbōchō to interoperate with the JGSDF as a primary training and deployment tool during peacetime, rather than having to liaison through the Ministry of Defense, saving money in both departments.\n\nOf course, this means that the JGSDF will suffer additional combat training deficiencies so long as the defense budget remains minimal, which is already putting a strain on retention and readiness."

 Japan.100006101.t: "Type 90 Kai?"
 Japan.100006101.d: "The need for a tank in the defense of the home islands is an important role that is also difficult to satisfy. Until the introduction of the third-generation Type 90 MBT, Japanese tanks like the Type 61 and Type 70 have always been outdated by the time of their introduction. The terrain of Japan is very difficult- going from mountainous forests to soggy rice paddies to enormous, sprawling metropolitan centers means that a tank will be heavily limited by its mobility and weight.\n\nOur newest Type 90 MBT is the equal of other modern Western-style tanks such as the Leopard 2 or Abrams, but it still has some limitations that complicate its modernization into a capable fourth-generation battle tank. The aforementioned weight consideration informed the design of the Type 90, resulting in relatively little unused space that could be used for future upgrades to communications, sensors, and electronics. This isn't to suggest that an ugprade of the Type 90 to a fourth-generation standard is impossible, but may be wasteful given the relatively few Type 90s in service. We should start planning now for either the Type 90's upgrade plan or drafting requirements for its successor.\n\nThere is also the less popular consideration that, as technology advances, a main battle tank is no longer necessary to fill the role that it originally provided. France has demonstrated with its AMX-10RC as well as the USA with the newly trialed Mobile Gun System that a 105mm gun on a wheeled platform can be a capable fire support system for mechanized infantry. In addition, new missile and communications systems for helicopters offer the possibility of non-line of sight anti-tank capability with more mobility than a ground-based system. These options don't answer the need for a heavy armor platform, but the question remains if that role will go the way of the battleship in the 21st century.\n\nWhat should we do?"

 Japan.100006102.t: "Equipment Specialization: Infantry Corps"
 Japan.100006102.d: "Here are some of our theorists' proposals for a new generation of hardware to equip a highly specialized infantry structure. If we don't see enough value in any of these, we don't need to choose one- in addition to an up-front cost, adopting one of these will increase the maintenance cost of our hardware by a significant amount. There is no turning back once we adopt one, and we can only choose one.\n\nKasha (Burning Chariot) Project: Analogue to the USA's Land Warrior project. This aims to create a universal \"medium\" infantry brigade for the JGSDF that operates from a wheeled APC like the Type 96. Each infantryman will be equipped with a suite of systems, including a display visor, medical monitoring subsystem, personal cooling//heating unit, and computer for communication within the platoon. The goal is to improve command and control as well as individual performance under combat conditions. This is an ambitious and expensive project to undertake.\n\nHeavy IFV Design: Doctrinal shift for heavy infantry from a 25t to a 35t IFV. The existing Type 89 IFV has potent armament but limited protection, especially against autocannon fire. As such, its ability to perform its role in the 21st century is in question. If we are willing to accept an even higher unit cost, our future IFV requirements will include armor proof against 40mm cannon fire and equivalent mobility to enable it to operate in ever-challenging Japanese terrain.\n\nNext-Generation Infantry Kit: Allowance for higher unit cost in infantry weapons. Rather than focus on medium or heavy infantry, we will aim to improve all of the personal weapons of our infantry, providing a higher budget for domestic replacements for the Type 89 rifle, Type 79 and 87 ATGMs, and Type 91 MANPADS, among other license produced weapon systems we will aim to replace."

 Japan.100006200.t: "Private Dockyard Industrial Subsidies"
 Japan.100006200.d: "Unlike the USA and other countries with large navies, Japan has no state-owned shipyards. After the war, all state shipyards were turned over to private industry, which continues to this day. The government provides contracts to private shipyards to produce vessels for the JMSDF, which has been sufficient for procurement during peacetime. However, while this means private industry has accumulated experience with producing military vessels, this experience is of limited commercial value due to Japan's laws against exporting arms to other countries. We are these shipyards' only customers for military vessels, which offers little incentive for them to reserve significant infrastructure and expertise devoted to our needs unless provided with a subsidy for doing so.\n\nThis subsidy isn't a factor if we adopt a higher level of defense expenditure with which to finance more regular vessel contracts, but with Japan's habit of maintaining §HTiny Defense Spending§!, removing this subsidy means the military output of these shipyards is lower when we keep our budget slim.\n\nWith a draft of the maritime defense budget under review, representatives of these enterprises are asking for us to confirm if we want to continue these subsidies at their current level or reduce them. We could also remove the subsidies entirely and give these enterprises freedom to dedicate themselves to civilian shipbuilding, though this would significantly reduce our naval output at §HTiny Defense Spending§!, and would be criticized by the opposition."

 Japan.100006201.t: "Don't Call It A Carrier!"
 Japan.100006201.d: "There have been discussions about equipping the JMSDF with a naval aviation capability more substantial than the helicopter deck operations of the Ōsumi class landing ships, but controversy surrounds this proposal. An aircraft carrier is seen as a force projection tool, something that a defense force should not need- so the argument goes. Whether you call it a carrier or some euphemism to avoid labeling it as such, naval aviation is an important supplment to land-based naval strike aircraft, providing faster response and better coordination. However, the issue remains that conventional carriers are expensive to maintain and require other assets to escort them.\n\nAdvanced Helicopter Destroyers: One alternative to a full-sized aircraft carrier are light carriers optimized for a variety of missions such as sea control and anti-submarine warfare, like the Soviet Kiev class or British Invincible class. The Kiev class is an interesting example in particular due to its heavy anti-surface armament. We already have the Shirane class of helicopter destroyers- the development of our Helicoper Operators into much larger versions of these that could also field fixed-wing light aircraft is an obvious evolution.\n\nMegacarriers: Of course, there's also a case to be made for a defensive carrier that is large enough to act as a moveable airbase. A single vessel of this size would give us an ability to strike at an invading enemy task force without risking an attritional exchange between surface combatants, which presents a credible deterrent against a possible hostile naval power that might have a larger surface fleet than we do. The cost of this, of course, would be enormous, and may provoke the Chinese or Koreans."

 Japan.100006202.d: "The guided-missile destroyer has become the core combatant in modern naval combat due to many factors- with the increasing sophistication and danger posed by anti-ship guided missiles being the most significant one. A vessel that can carry many of these while simultaneously being able to defend against them is a highly valuable asset for any navy, which we have followed with our relatively new Kongō class. However, though Kongō and her sisters are highly capable, we must evaluate their effectiveness in a potential 21st century naval confrontation. Experiments are being made into stealth equipped ships, such as the Americans' Surface Combatant for the 21st Century program, and it seems another paradigm shift in naval combat may be on the horizon. We have to decide how we will get ahead of it.\n\nDatalink Destroyers: One method that develops the Kongō class further is to pair them and successor classes of DDG with an even more advanced, stealthy destroyer that can act as a missile launch platform. The concept suggests using the sensors and air defense capability of the conventional guided-missile-destroyer to protect and locate targets for the hidden, missile-laden stealth ships. The goal of this is to improve survivability against enemy anti-ship missile salvos, as well as improve the lethality of a task force by delivering more anti-ship missiles in a single salvo.\n\nCore Cruisers: Alternatively, we can turn towards significantly larger vessels that can act as a flagship of a task force, providing more capability than can be provided by a relatively smaller destroyer. This concept uses two different ships as possible patterns to follow- the first being the US Ticonderoga class guided-missile cruiser, which can act as an air-defense shield for the task force, combined with a powerful sensor array to also act as the eyes for smaller vessels. The other, and more ambitious pattern, is modeled after the Soviet Kirov class battlecruiser to deliver a larger volume of highly sophisticated missiles onto an enemy task force before returning to base, which could be very useful in an attritional battle against a much larger naval force.\n\nArsenal Ships: Of course, taking the Kirov concept further, we can revive the idea of the battleship with the capabilities needed to excel in future naval combat. By taking a very large vessel and dedicating its volume to carrying an enormous amount of anti-ship and anti-air missiles, we can create a centerpiece of a task force that can deter or destroy any threat trying to confront it. Of course, such a ship would be monstrously expensive to build and maintain."

 Japan.100006203.t: "21st Century Escorts"
 Japan.100006203.d: "The evolving mission for frigates and corvettes is building up to another classification crisis. As frigates become heavier, more well-armed, and more multi-mission capability is demanded of them, their distinction from destroyers is becoming less clear. In addition, the anti-submarine mission traditionally demanded of them is becoming increasingly dominated by smaller corvettes and larger helicopter operators. If we want to significantly adjust the concept of our light forces, we need clear misions for them.\n\nFFX Program: Our last generation of destroyer escorts, equivalent to frigates in other navies, are capable vessels, but their survivability is questionable in a modern sensor environment. A new frigate that incorporates low-observable design principles with a more potent anti-surface armament would allow these lighter ships to share tasks with the larger destroyers in service.\n\nSpecialized Escorts: Given the threat that submarine warfare poses to modern commercial shipping, it may be more important to have exceptionally capable anti-submarine vessels than frigates that can do a destroyer's job. We can let the guided-missile destroyers operate in their own domain, while the destroyer escorts provide air defense and sensor coverage for smaller patrol vessels dedicated to anti-submarine coverage.\n\nVersatile Corvettes: Japan does not currently operate any corvettes, opting instead for slightly larger destroyer escorts that are equivalent in classification to frigates. Though limited in how much space they can offer for weapon systems, we can emphasize production of these smaller vessels that can provide capability approaching that of a frigate in a much more easily concealed package. Whether this is worth the increased cost of production is uncertain."

 Japan.100006300.t: "Air Defense Force Reservists"
 Japan.100006300.d: "Keeping pilots trained full-time is expensive and, perhaps more importantly for the JSDF, exhaustive in manpower to support them. Though the JASDF's readiness level is an important defense and political consideration, the fact remains that a lot of our pilots spend their time performing other duties instead of accumulating hours during peacetime. This means we have a lot of restless pilots stuck performing menial tasks that wind up ending their service without renewal and taking their talents to the private sector.\n\nOne way of alleviating this could be to allow flying personnel to, once qualified, transition a reserve where they can maintain civilian jobs and return for periodic training and recertification. Not all personnel will be able to move to this system though, and the stress on the economy of mobilizing these air reservists will be felt in our defense budget, as we compensate them for lost wages. In addition, the immediate readiness will suffer so long as we remain on §HTiny Defense Spending§!. However, they will be much quicker to train back up to a competent standard before the defense budget mobilizes to alert readiness, and this has the potential to save a lot of money on personnel costs over time so long as peace reigns.\n\n§PHINT: Disband most of your air wings while§! §Y$DYNAMIC_MODIFIER_JAP_NATIVE_HARDWARE$§! §Pis active, as they will cost much more with this policy selected.

 Japan.100006301.t: "Future Air Combatant"
 Japan.100006301.d: "The F-2 program has been a valuable lesson in the expenses and difficulties in developing a sophisticated modern aircraft. The resulting aircraft is quite capable, but very expensive per unit. Any future air procurement program we undertake must learn from this lesson avoid the shortcomings that the F-2 unfortunately suffered. The Americans have recently begun flying their new F-22 stealth fighter, and as this technology becomes more common we must evaluate how an air confrontation may look ten years from now. If we want to commit to a radical approach to aircraft design, we should tread carefully. Here are some of the proposals:\n\nFuture Multirole Initiative: The F-15J is a very good air superiority fighter, but too specialized for a future air theater. Expanding on the F-2's role, a common platform that can engage enemy fighters, deliver ground support, and launch anti-ship missiles while remaining hard to detect suits the needs of the JASDF well. This requirement would sacrifice range to carry the extra payload in a low-observable platform, and would be significantly more expensive.\n\nF-X Program: The F-22 is a very promising aircraft that we could pursue further development of if the Americans will not sell it ouright to us. It's a concept without compromise- solely designed for air dominance using new stealth technology. If we lose air superiority, none of the other multirole concessions made for a design will matter- specialization is the only way to assure overmatch against a more numerous opponent. Not a pound for air-to-ground.\n\nKaminari (Thunder) Project: The Americans have invested heavily into unmanned aerial vehicles for reconnaissance and intelligence, and the capability of these drones is expanding rapidly. The technology is not yet here, but theorists conceive of a partner UAV that can accompany friendly fighters and autonomously support them by designating targets, launching munitions, and, if need be, sacrificing themselves to save a manned airccraft. If we are willing to wait, we could pioneer an unmanned airforce."

 Japan.100006302.t: "Evolving Attacker Requirement"
 Japan.100006302.d: "As air defense systems continue to advance in capability, the vital ground support that modern armies have come to rely on from aircraft is becoming more difficult and expensive to reliably deliver. To respond to this, munitions are becoming longer range to stay out of air defense coverage, and their guidance is becoming more precise at the same time. The last generation of attack planes flying low and fast to deliver heavy payloads of bombs is becoming obsolete. Our technology industry is ready to deliver solutions to this, if we're willing to incentivize their research. Some of these options are as follows:\n\nBattle Trainers: Rather than field expensive, dedicated attack aircraft, we will expand on the evolution of the battle trainer. Our old Mitsubishi T-2 trainer and F-1 strike aircraft demonstrated this concept already, and though they've been replaced by the T-4 and F-2 which are completely different airframes, our next generation trainer aircraft could bring a return to this design idea. A drawback of this is a more demanding and expensive training program required before pilots can be cleared to fly a more capable trainer.\n\nJoint Strike Fighter: Outside of the employment of cruise missiles, there is a limit to how much stand-off protection our strike aircraft can rely on. The simple fact is that multirole aircraft are going to take losses from ground fire, and our designs should accommodate this. A cheap attack plane that can deliver a large payload and evade enemy interception is the ideal balance we should aim for. \nHINT: Aircraft stats have no effect on their chance to be shot down by AA in HOI4.\n\nTactical Strike Fighter: Rather than continue the trend of pursuing multirole fighters, a sufficiently equipped strike fighter can adapt to different attack missions if the air superiority mission is already committed by a dedicated air superiority fighter. A medium-sized strike aircraft could be used to support all attack requirements for the JASDF, so long as we're prepared to accept a very expensive airframe."
