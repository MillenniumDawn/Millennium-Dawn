 ### MOLDOVAN EVENTS ###
 moldova.1.t: "The 2001 Moldovan Presidential Elections"
 moldova.1.d: "The 2001 presidential elections are contested between Dumitru Braghis leader of the Braghis Alliance a coalition of several socialist parties and Vladimir Voronin leader of the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova which had seen a popular resurgence, by the time of the election the constitution had been altered so that the president is elected by the parliament rather then popular vote. Regardless parliament has to decide which president will be elected in what is perhaps one of the most crucial elections our nation has yet."
 moldova.1.a: "Vladimir Voronin wins the election"
 moldova.1.b: "Dumitru Braghis wins the election"
 moldova_news.1.t: "Vladimir Voronin Elected President Of Moldova"
 moldova_news.1.d: "Vladimir Voronin of the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova has been elected as president of Moldova. Being seen as the most likely outcome Voronin's victory was attributed to the rising backlash towards economic problems and corruption as well as a rise in Soviet era nostalgia, Many are questioning weather Voronin's mandate will be a return to communism like in the Moldovian SSR or a democratic one. "
 moldova_news.1.a: "Lenin brought us light!"

 moldova_news.2.t: "Dumitru Braghis elected President Of Moldova"
 moldova_news.2.d: "Dumitru Braghis of the Braghis alliance a coalition of centre-left parties has been elected as president of Moldova. Seen as the least likely outcome Braghis managed with enough parliamentary support to be elected as president of Moldova. Many are now wondering what will the new president do to change Moldova for better or worse."

Igor Dodon which is leading the hardliner faction of the party is calling for far more radical policies in comparison to his predecessor with him calling for a massive crackdown on the recent unrest after the resignation of Vladimir Voronin as well as even greater relations with Russia and a promotion of Moldovan nationalism. On the other hand Zinaida Graceanii, leader of the reformist faction is calling for economic reforms, a relaxation on political repression and building better relations with the west while still holding strong ties to Russia.

 moldova.14.d: "Today is a historic moment in what is known as a frozen conflict betweem our nation and Transnistria. With Negotiations starting the main point the Transnistrian side is concerned about is it's autonomy with it favouring having a certain control over it's affairs and the proposal also mentions a withdrawal of Russian forces from the area which could possibly not be favoured by the Transnistrian side. Many in our government are deeply divided on this issue with some claiming that centralization with limited autonomy will work while others claim that we need to give the region extended autonomy which in term allows it to have control over most of it's affairs like policing, education and healthcare and which would allow russian troops to stay in the region for peacekeeping reasons for a short time and would see Moldova turning into a federated state. The stakes are high as if we fail in the negotiations it could lead to severe consequences therefore we should be really careful as our nation's fate depends on us."

However some support the Moldovan proposal as it could allow Transnistria to have more economic opportunities and to be seen as equal to the rest of Moldova while most of our population has shown opposition to the Moldovan proposal on the basis that it does not respect the rights of Transnistria."
