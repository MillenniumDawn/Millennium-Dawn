 generic.1.d_neutral_good: "For a long time the [From.GetAdjective] government has sought to align the path of our countries, and has expressed a great interest in [Root.GetAdjective] politics. Recently this intensified when [From.GetRulingParty] started pushing their [From.GetRulingIdeology] propaganda with a number of speeches and reading material distributed to the [Root.GetAdjective] people. \n\nNow even a number of politicians and other officials are being swayed by the [From.GetAdjective] propaganda, and have started advocating for [From.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] in [Root.GetName]."
 generic.1.d_bad: "For a long time the [From.GetAdjective] government has sought to align the path of our countries, and has often tried to meddle in [Root.GetName]'s politics. Recently this has intensified, as [From.GetRulingParty] started pushing their [From.GetRulingIdeology] propaganda with no respect for [Root.GetAdjective] political traditions. A number of speeches and other [From.GetRulingIdeology] material is already being distributed to the [Root.GetAdjective] people. It seems that even a number of politicians and other officials are being swayed by the [From.GetAdjective] propaganda and have begun advocating for [From.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] in [Root.GetName]."

Pilots returning from the region report having spotted [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetWingShort] going down in flames over [From.GetMissionRegion] after taking heavy enemy fire.

 election.1.t: "GENERIC ELECTION"
 election.1.d: ""
 election.1.a: ""
 election.2.t: "Election: Public Opposes Rearmament"
 election.2.d: "In the upcoming election, support for [Root.GetRulingParty] is still high, the people having confidence in [Root.GetLeader]'s leadership. However, the party's pursuit of increasing [Root.GetName]'s focus on military matters has not been entirely popular with the public, with a significant segment of the citizens considering this ill-advised jingoism. War is yet to reach our border and few would like to see [Root.GetName] take aggressive action. Cooperating with other major parties who share our concerns for the safety of the nation, we will still be able to rule after the election, albeit with diminished support."
 election.2.a: "The people must be heard."
 election.2.b: "Protecting our sovereignty comes first."
 election.3.t: "Election: Public Demands Rearmament"
 election.3.d: "The ongoing war approaching our borders has loomed over the upcoming election, with many voters being concerned that [Root.GetName] is not prepared for being thrown into this conflict or whatever may arise from it. They demand we increase our precautions and ensure that our nation is ready for war. While the majority still support [Root.GetRulingParty], we may lose them to more radical elements if we don't alleviate their apprehensions."
 election.3.a: "The people have the right to feel safe."
 election.3.b: "Many are still in favor of diplomatic solutions."
 election.4.t: "Election: Fascists in Government?"
 election.4.d: "An aggressively nationalist sentiment has grown in [Root.GetName], giving rise to several parties promoting fascist ideals: a state enforcing its power through force. One of these in particular has won favor in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to cooperate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."
 election.4.a: "Rather them than the communists!"
 election.4.b: "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 election.5.t: "Election: Communists in Government?"
 election.5.d: "The communist movement in [Root.GetName], fueled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government. Although they consider our democratic institutions to be little more than bourgeois tyranny, they seem eager to make the changes they want to see through cooperating with the government rather than overthrowing it."
 election.5.a: "Rather reform than revolution!"
 election.5.b: "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 election.6.t: "Election: Democratic Parties in Minority"
 election.6.d: "Politics in [Root.GetName] have grown increasingly radicalized. Where there was once broad support for the parties which supported democratic ideals and [Root.GetName]'s representative institutions, more voters have turned to the political extremes in this election. The parties in the political middle, even if they choose to set aside their differences, no longer form a majority. To avoid a weak minority government, we have no choice but to cooperate with either fascists or communists."
 election.6.a: "We will work with the fascists to strengthen [Root.GetName]."
 election.6.b: "Joining with the communists, we can facilitate social change."
 election.6.c: "A minority government, although weak, is preferable."
 election.7.t: "Fascists Influence Foreign Policy"
 election.7.d: "Accepting the fascists into our political coalition has had an impact on our foreign policy. Despite their vehement nationalism, they have sympathizers abroad who approve of the influence they've been given in [Root.GetName]. Totalitarian governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies. Maintaining ties to these nations, no matter the distaste [Root.GetRulingParty] may have for their ideals, may be necessary to retain the support of the fascists backing our government."
 election.7.a: "We can use some allies against greater threats."
 election.7.b: "With friends like that, we'd need no enemies."
 election.8.t: "Communists Influence Foreign Policy"
 election.8.d: "Communists often consider themselves to be part of an international revolution, and our choice to accept them as partners in our government has drawn the attention of many of their international allies. Representatives of communist parties maintain close ties to nations which have abandoned our form of government in favor of a dictatorship of the proletariat, ties which we may need to acknowledge in [Root.GetAdjective] foreign policy if we wish to retain their support."
 election.8.a: "We should embrace our common causes."
 election.8.b: "Down that path lies the dissolution of [Root.GetName] itself."
 election.11.t: "Election: Fascist Majority"
 election.11.d: "This election has been devastating for the very institution it represents. The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of a fascist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler. While many consider taking up arms against this violation of the democratic ideals that allowed them this mandate to begin with, others consider the use of violence to only confirm their ideals further."
 election.11.a: "It is a black day for [Root.GetName], but the people have spoken."
 election.11.b: "We will not give up our liberty without a fight!"
 election.12.t: "Election: Communist Majority"
 election.12.d: "The current election has resulted in victory for the communist parties, with mixed reactions from the former administration. While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."
 election.12.a: "This is troubling, but they truly do represent the majority."
 election.12.b: "We must stop them before they abolish every sign of dissenting thought!"
 election.13.t: "Election: Magnate Favors Fascism"
 election.13.d: "An influential industrialist behind one of the companies we have chosen to work with for our industrial production has recently made a number of statements on politics that members of the administration found troubling. He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as fascist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership. Denouncing the magnate and his ideals might sour our relationship with the company, but leaving them unchecked would give him a platform for spreading propaganda that erodes all that [Root.GetRulingParty] stands for."
 election.13.a: "He can say what he pleases, we need not endorse it."
 election.13.b: "We cannot rely on fascists to develop and protect [Root.GetName]."
 election.14.t: "Election: Wartime Exception"
 election.14.d: "[Root.GetName] is in a state of war. Normally, an election would be held at this time, but being in the midst of an important conflict many argue that cannot afford to spend time on political campaigning, or a change of leadership if that should come about. Meanwhile, others claim that declaring the ongoing war a valid reason for skipping elections is the first step towards eroding [Root.GetAdjective] democracy. After all, letting military matters take precedence over the people's influence could be a slippery slope."
 election.14.a: "Elections will be held as usual."
 election.14.b: "We can take care of such matters when this war is through."
 election.15.t: "Election: Government Contested"
 election.15.d: "With an upcoming election, people are beginning to question the capability of the current administration to pursue the ongoing war. [Root.GetName] has suffered greatly and popular opinion has turned against those who seem to be leading our nation to defeat. While our people are determined to see the war to the end, they would rather see another government ending it."
 election.15.a: "This crisis of trust is highly unfortunate."
 election.15.b: "Let the political landscape shift to keep the people united."
 election.16.t: "[Root.GetLeader] Enjoys Public Support"
 election.16.d: "With the present election, the opposition, insofar as it exists, has criticized the increasingly authoritarian reign of [Root.GetRulingParty]. They question whether the electorate has any power at all, or if it's all just for show.\n\nHowever, the support for [Root.GetLeader] appears to remain high, and although the circumstances of the election are questioned by international community, it has not been contested domestically. It appears that even if [Root.GetName] is no longer ruled by the people, the people support their ruler... at least the ones who made it to the ballots."
 election.16.a: "One people, one leader."
 election.17.t: "Election Results Questioned"
 election.17.d: "Although the [Root.GetLeader] regime has strong-armed most of its opponents into silence, some have still spoken out about the recent election, accusing the [Root.GetRulingParty] of rigging the results and ignoring the clear efforts to elect a parliament opposed to their policies.\n\nThe government brushes these objections aside as an effort to divide the people against itself. However, the fact remains that the majority of the people seem to have reservations about their rule, and the opposition, although silenced for now, has made its point."
 election.17.a: "Splitters!"
 political.1.t: "Communism on the Rise"
 political.1.d: "'While workers rise up against their oppressors around the world, those who claim to have achieved class consciousness in [Root.GetName] sit idly by and wait for change to come from within a political system so thoroughly corrupt, only revolution could save us from it!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] communist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 political.1.a: "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 political.1.a.tt: "Increases the chance of internal support for a communist coup."
 political.1.b: "A movement for the people must seek support from the people."
 political.1.b.tt: "Increases the chance of popular support for a communist uprising."
 political.2.t: "Marxist Sympathies in Government"
 political.2.d: "Although the party line of the [Root.GetRulingParty] is to strongly oppose revolutionary socialism, keeping a watchful eye on the nation's radical left-wing elements, some people in government are more open to the possibility. If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."
 political.2.a: "We'll keep a close eye on them too, for many reasons."
 political.2.a.tt: "If public support is sufficient, a coup can be executed."
 political.3.t: "Communists Execute Coup"
 political.3.d: "While the popular movement for communist revolution has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."
 political.3.a: "The tides of history will sweep away the past."
 political.4.t: "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 political.4.d: "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 political.4.a: "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 political.5.t: "Soldiers Desert to Communist Partisans"
 political.5.d: "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 political.5.a: "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 political.6.t: "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
 political.6.d: "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"
 political.6.a: "Those who wish to make history must act today!"
 political.6.b: "Revolution is inevitable. The inevitable can wait."
 political.7.t: "Fascism on the Rise"
 political.7.d: "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been subjected too long to the incompetent rule of [Root.GetRulingParty]! They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."
 political.7.a: "The higher-ups may harbor unspoken sympathies."
 political.7.a.tt: "Increases the chance of internal support for a fascist coup."
 political.7.b: "The younger generation will take up the torch."
 political.7.b.tt: "Increases the chance of popular support for a fascist coup."
 political.8.t: "Fascist Sympathies in the Military"
 political.8.d: "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Fascist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 political.8.a: "The national spirit outranks the government."
 political.9.t: "Fascist Coup d'état"
 political.9.d: "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.9.a: "A strong state is needed to protect people from themselves."
 political.10.t: "Civil War for Fascism"
 political.10.d: "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.10.a: "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
 political.10.b: "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
 political.11.t: "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d: "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.11.a: "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 political.12.t: "The Threat of Communism"
 political.12.d: "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.12.a: "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 political.13.t: "Move Towards Democracy"
 political.13.d: "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."
 political.13.a: "We can discuss this internally for a start."
 political.13.a.tt: "Increases the chance of internal support for arranging elections."
 political.13.b: "Knowing we're in the right, we can afford allowing our enemies to talk more openly."
 political.13.b.tt: "Increases the chance of people voicing support for democracy and forming an opposition."
 political.14.t: "[Root.GetRulingParty] Debates Democracy"
 political.14.d: "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."
 political.14.a: "The choice may not always stand between liberty and death."
 political.14.a.tt: "The government may arrange elections when the policy has majority support."
 political.15.t: "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 political.15.d: "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 political.15.a: "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 political.16.t: "Public Call for Elections"
 political.16.d: "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."
 political.16.a: "Even if reform is happening, we must show our strength by suppressing this defiance."
 political.16.b: "Let the people be heard."
 political.17.t: "Public Election in [Root.GetName]"
 political.17.d: "As freedom of expression and assembly have grown to become increasingly accepted in [Root.GetName], the faction within the [Root.GetRulingParty] calling for holding elections has gone from secret conspirators to publicly supported reformers. Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."
 political.17.a: "Those loyal to the [Root.GetRulingParty] will support the decision now."
 political.17.b: "The reforms need broader support before an election can be held."
 political.18.t: "Fascists Demand Referendum"
 political.18.d: "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 political.18.a: "Suppress this hateful movement!"
 political.18.b: "Don't pay any attention to them."
 political.18.c: "If the people want it, we'll hold the referendum."
 political.19.t: "Communists Demand Referendum"
 political.19.d: "Marxist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."
 political.19.a: "Un-[Root.GetAdjective] activities must be stopped!"
 political.19.b: "Ignore them, they're just causing trouble."
 political.19.c: "The referendum is preferable to a bloody revolt."
 political.20.t: "Democrats Demand Referendum"
 political.20.d: "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the people ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent. What will happen to us if we make peaceful revolution impossible?"
 political.20.a: "Round them up."
 political.20.b: "Just proceed as usual."
 political.20.c: "If we accept the referendum, perhaps we can preserve our legacy."
 political.21.t: "Fascists March on [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 political.21.d: "Having been refused their referendum, almost a token attempt at seizing power legally, the fascists have used their significant public support and connections in the [Root.GetAdjective] military to attempt a coup. The [Root.GetRulingParty] government has refused their terms and claims it is going to fight to the end to preserve [Root.GetName] as we know it."
 political.21.a: "We will stop them at any cost!"
 political.21.b: "The fascists carry the true spirit of [Root.GetName]!"
 political.22.t: "Communists Rise Up"
 political.22.d: "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the communist movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."
 political.22.a: "We won't allow them to ruin our country!"
 political.22.b: "The fire of the revolution must be extinguished with the blood of the oppressors!"
 political.23.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Spring"
 political.23.d: "After their attempt at a public referendum to institute democracy was refused, the people behind the suggestion have dismissed the [Root.GetLeader] regime as incorrigible. A broad coalition of rebel groups, united by their common goal of instituting more representative political systems in [Root.GetName], have taken up arms and announced that they will not rest until the [Root.GetRulingParty] is overthrown."
 political.23.a: "Spare us from this mob rule!"
 political.23.b: "At long last, [Root.GetName] is free!"
 political.24.t: "Fascists Ridiculed"
 political.24.d: "The [Root.GetAdjective] people's infatuation with nationalistic pride and attempts to revive the glories of the past appears to have passed. A rude awakening for its ardent supporters, whose uniforms, militaristic posturing and over-the-top speeches are now more commonly the subject of mockery than sympathies.\n\nOnce considered a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] power base, [Root.GetAdjective] fascism is now increasingly seen as an absurd, extremist position and an attack on the most fundamental values of our nation, the very nation they claim to hold in such high regard. The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."
 political.24.a: "What a bunch of clowns."
 political.25.t: "Communist Fad Blows Over"
 political.25.d: "Many communists had predicted that [Root.GetName] was going to be the next nation to fall to the so-called international revolution, but after a few months of strikes and red flags in the streets, the movement seems to have died down. The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."
 political.25.a: "What a bunch of hypocrites."
 political.26.t: "Democratic Movement Goes Silent"
 political.26.d: "After a few months of loud opposition against [Root.GetLeader]'s regime, calling for public elections and more liberal laws on freedom of assembly and speech, the movement seems to have fallen apart. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."

We now see eye to eye with our fellow [Root.GetAdjective]s, and together we will rebuild our great nation.

Let us ask ourselves a better question: Does the future belong to the [From.GetAdjective] or does it belong to [Root.GetNameDef]?'\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s speech today suggested that [Root.GetName] is on the path to war.

 nuke_dropped.8.d: "A nuclear bomb was detonated today over the capital of the United States. In an attack clearly directed at the political center and historical legacy of the US, the White House, the Capitol and a number of monuments and memorials were wiped off the face of the Earth. Even the Burning of Washington over a century ago pales in comparison to the destruction visited upon the city by this devastating weapon.\n\nAlthough President [From.Owner.GetLeader] has been brought to safety, the nation has been shaken to its core. No doubt, the US hoped to be the first and only country to wield such a weapon. Those hopes have now been shattered in the worst possible way."
 nuke_dropped.8.a: "One nation, indivisible, versus one atom, divisible."
 nuke_dropped.8.b: "The eagle will rise from the ashes like a phoenix."
 nuke_dropped.9.t: "Atomic Bombing of Rome"
 nuke_dropped.9.d: "A nuclear explosion struck the city of Rome today, shocking people around the world. Due to its historical and artistic treasures, many had never thought the ancient city would be the target of such indiscriminate destruction. With the Vatican City also partially destroyed and the whereabouts of the Pope unknown, the event has horrified not only Italians, but Catholics around the world.\n\nRome's rapid growth in the past decade has been nearly completely undone by the attack. For a while, it looked like the city could aid the nation's recovery after the war was over. Those hopes have now been turned to dust, along with many people."
 nuke_dropped.9.a: "Bomba Iacta Est!"
 nuke_dropped.9.b: "Rome won't be rebuilt in one day..."
 nuke_dropped.10.t: "Atomic Bombing of Paris"
 nuke_dropped.10.d: "Today, a nuclear device was detonated over the city of Paris, causing widespread destruction and countless casualties. France was in shock as its capital suffered what may be the most devastating attack it ever experienced, despite centuries of wars and revolutions. The Parisians had perhaps expected conquest, but not utter, brutal desolation.\n\nAny victory parades at Champs-Élysées past the remains of the Arc de Triomphe seem unlikely in the city's current state. Perhaps the coming decades will see the birth of a new Paris, but Paris in the public mind, the city built in the Belle Époque, is gone forever."
 nuke_dropped.10.a: "The city of light has burned out."
 nuke_dropped.10.b: "Only yesterday, it seemed like we'd always have Paris."
 nuke_dropped.11.t: "Atomic Bombing of Moscow"
 nuke_dropped.11.d: "A city many have tried and failed to conquer, Moscow was the target of a nuclear attack today. The explosion was directed at the heart of [From.Owner.GetAdjective] leadership, the Kremlin having been nearly completely destroyed by the blast.\n\n[From.Owner.GetLeader], having grown more aware and fearful of all possible and impossible threats recently, evacuated in time and survived. However, even the vastness of [From.Owner.GetName] may not be enough to escape such a ruthless enemy. Indeed, if this continues, the nation will soon consist only of two kinds of wastelands: Those which were there in the first place, and those created by its enemies."
 nuke_dropped.11.a: "Won't a nuclear winter only make Moscow a more difficult target?"
 nuke_dropped.11.b: "They may burn every city we have, but they will never take them."
 nuke_dropped.12.t: "Atomic Bombing of Copenhagen"
 nuke_dropped.12.d: "Today, the city of Copenhagen was struck by a nuclear explosion. Having grown after escaping destruction in the Great War thanks to Denmark's neutrality, the capital has never experienced an attack close to this devastating since the Napoleonic Wars. The surrounding area of Öresund has also seen significant fallout and survivors have begun escaping to Fyn and the mainland in fear of further attacks.\n\nKing Christian X's whereabouts are currently unknown, and the nation's morale has been severely damaged by the attack. It remains to be seen if this is the beginning of the end for one of Europe's oldest nations."
 nuke_dropped.12.a: "Something is irradiated in the state of Denmark."
 nuke_dropped.12.b: "The city has burned before, but not perished."
 nuke_dropped.12.c: "With plutonium we bring the Danes to their knees!"
 nuke_dropped.13.t: "Atomic Bombing of Stockholm"
 nuke_dropped.13.d: "The beautiful city of Stockholm, proud Venice of the North, was struck by a nuclear bomb today. Despite their best efforts to stay neutral in the past, the Swedes have now paid the ultimate price for international conflict. The epicenter of the blast was in the middle of south central Stockholm, an area intended for future development and grand construction projects, now irreversibly destroyed.\n\nMuch of the city is beyond recognition, but the old structures at Slussen seem to have survived the blast better than expected. It has been decided that it should stand untouched forever as a monument to the city's resilience."
 nuke_dropped.13.a: "With this, Swedish neutrality will be but a memory."

[From.From.GetLeader] of the [From.From.GetRulingParty] has emerged as the new leader amid the turmoil.

Though [From.GetAdjective] leader [From.GetLeader] strongly denied the accusations, it is widely know that the two leaders don't see eye to eye. With [From.GetAdjective]-[From.From.GetAdjective] ties at all time low, [From.From.GetName] vowed to the public to \"irradicate [From.GetAdjective] influence from [From.From.GetName]\", and otherwise double down on the [From.From.GetRulingIdeology] direction that the ruling [From.From.GetRulingParty] have been steering [From.From.GetNameWithFlag] towards."

 News_influence.6.t: "Drama as [From.From.GetNameWithFlag] collapse into Civil War!"
 News_influence.6.d: "Traumatic scenes from [From.From.GetNameWithFlag] could be seen today, as the last few days of protests, uncertainty and strange military movements gave way to gunfire, suffering and fleeing civilians. While details are scarce, it seems several whole units of the [From.From.GetAdjective] Army have declared for the armed opposition against [From.From.GetLeader] and the [From.From.GetRulingParty] ([From.From.GetRulingIdeology]). A opposition leader, speaking to WNN under conditions of anonymity, said that they \"expect significant help from [From.GetNameWithFlag] in their quest to overthrow the illegitimate [From.From.GetAdjective] tyrant [From.From.GetLeader]\".\n\nAlthough [From.GetAdjective] leadership have expressed their \"surprise about these dramatic developments\", this is given little credibility by close watchers of [From.GetAdjective]-[From.From.GetAdjective] relations. One analyst described the situation like this; \"It's clear that this in reality was a [From.GetAdjective]-backed coup attempt that failed to secure their objectives fast enough, resulting in a tense standoff that degraded into what now looks like a full civil war\". Several world leaders, especially those with a [From.From.GetRulingIdeology] have had less than diplomatic words for the as of yet unconfirmed [From.GetAdjective] involvement.\n\nWith the two different sides in the conflict represent not only stark differences in domestic, but also international direction, it will be interesting to follow if other countries also get involved in the conflict."

 econvent.2.d: "As the prices of houses and apartments have went through the roof, especially in the last year, people have taken out larger and larger loans to afford housing, while speculators have invested heavily in property, also using loaned money. Right now, this is coming to an end, fast. The prices are dropping, and people are trying to sell like there is no tomorrow. Many less fortunates will be stuck with huge loans they can't repay. As people are cursing both [Root.GetLeader] and the [Root.GetAdjective] Central Bank for causing this, we must make an public statement on how we intend to handle this crisis fast."
 econvent.2.a: "We will flood the system with cheap money to make the market bounce back."
 econvent.2.b: "This is painful, but housing prices had to come down."

 econvent.3.t: "Stock Market Crash"
 econvent.3.d: "It seems the chaos following the bursting of the housing-bubble has reached the Stock Market. The share prices of nearly all listed [Root.GetAdjective] companies tumbled down heavily this morning, and our currency fell a great deal too.

 econvent.4.d: "Despite the hot delicious latte-art espresso in your [Root.GetName] §R<3§! [Root.GetLeader]-cup, this is not a good day. Desperate financial moguls, their lobbyists, and the politicians they have made contributions to - all are swarming the [Root.GetAdjective] governing offices, and all have the same message: \"We need a bailout!\".\n\nApparently the dual shock of the Housing Downturn and the Stock Market Crash were too much for the financial sector to handle.

One theory is that we have become less competitive due to our relative high wages, another is that our competitors have increased the quality of their products. Others feel that the decrease in demand is just due to shifting trends abroad. Whatever the cause, there is not really much we can do about this except putting it behind us and working harder in the future."

 USA_2016_Recount.1.d: "After weeks of careful scrutiny, the final votes are being counted right now. This may be the closest election we've had in years. Yet the question remains. Who won the 2016 elections?"
 USA_2016_Recount.1.a: "After a close race, Donald Trump won the election."
 USA_2016_Recount.1.b: "After a close race, Hillary Clinton won the election."

 #Trump Wins 2016 Elections
 USA_2016_Recount_News.1.t: "Donald Trump Wins 2016 US Presidential Election."
 USA_2016_Recount_News.1.d: "Donald Trump has been confirmed the 45th President of the United States today after an election recount undertaken by Green Party President Jill Stein. Clinton, having conceded the election on November 9th, declined to call for a recount. Despite President-elect Trump's attempt to file legal motions to block the recounts, several other states were subject to recounts separate from Stein's efforts. These included Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Florida. Despite minor discrepancies, all states certified their original November 8th election results. \n\nWhile Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over three million votes, Trump carried enough swing states to net him a total of 301 electoral votes to Clinton's 227. As expected, Trump lost the Democratic strongholds of the West and upper East Coast, but won the American South, Midwest, and surprisingly Pennsylvania."

After a tight race, Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton pushed for a recount on the grounds that unspecified \"anomalies\" may have affected the election's outcome. \n\nAccording to the recount results, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over four million votes, one million more than last reported. This was enough to carry enough swing states to net Hillary a total of 301 electoral votes to Trump's 227. As expected, Trump lost the Democratic strongholds of the West and upper East Coast, but won the American South. Pennsylvania and the American Midwest, while Red in the original count, turned blue after the latest findings."

 sco.6.d: "[FROM.GetAdjective] troops joined thousands of others today in what is being described as a counter-terrorism exercise under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). While many have hailed these exercises as a symptom of successful international cooperation, others have reacted much less enthusiastically to this latest development. American and European analysts cited the deployment of long-range aircraft and substantial firepower as evidence that these exercises are meant not as practice for counter-terror operations but as a well-armed dress rehearsal for confrontation with the West."
 sco.6.a: "Are these threatening drills meant for our benefit?"

However Chinese dissatisfaction with this arrangement has reportedly led to Russia being forced into a more junior position within the organization. While both [CHI.GetLeader] and [SOV.GetLeader] have remained silent on this power struggle, Russian officials are reportedly furious with the Chinese and bitter about the humiliation of the Slavic giant that has taken place in full view of fellow SCO member states.

 ### Taiwanese Events ###
 taiwan.1.t: "228 Hand-in-Hand rally"
 taiwan.1.d: "A demonstration of solidarity. A human chain was formed with about two million people forming a 500km human chain. Starting at the harbor at Keelung, Taiwan's northernmost city, the chain wended its way to the southernmost tip of the island. The purpose was dual in nature. The Taiwanese wished for peace, but they were also protesting the deployment of missiles by the People's Republic of China aimed at Taiwan, their island neighbor. Some of the symbolism of the demonstration, particularly at the point in the event where participants \"turn away from China\" veered clearly toward support of Taiwanese independence, and hence was not attended by members of the Pan-Blue Coalition who countered the demonstration with an island-wide rally of their own days later."
 taiwan.1.a: "Let us never forget the victims."
 taiwan.2.t: "Typhoon Bilis"
 taiwan.2.d: "In preparation for Bilis, offices were closed across the island. In addition to the closure of businesses, flights to and from the island were rescheduled, and a typhoon relief center was established. Due to the threat of landslides, a landslide warning was issued for Taiwan. Though the storm had not yet made landfall, one person was killed in Taipei on August 22 after they were buried by a landslide triggered by the impending typhoon; this accounted for the first fatality caused by Bilis. Along with flight rescheduling, numerous airports were closed, and the Taiwan Stock Exchange was set to close on August 23. Meanwhile, hospitals extended service times in anticipation for patient admittance. Taiwanese coast guard members regulated fishing activity due to the threat of deadly wave action. The Port of Kaohsiung was closed throughout the duration of the storm. Due to the heightened demand for vegetables in the lead-up to the storm, the cost of such foods increased by 20 to 30 percent.\n\nBilis was a highly destructive tropical cyclone for Taiwan. Damage to the island's agricultural, fishing, and forestry industries amounted to US$133.5 million. The typhoon caused 14 fatalities and injured an additional 80 people. Power outages adversely impacted approximately 600,000 households, and 400 homes across Taiwan were destroyed. Several hundred thousand families experienced water shortage following the storm. In Cheng-Kung, a weather station recorded a 281 km/h wind gust, which broke the station's anemometer. A single landslide in the town of Jenai buried nine farmers. Tens of thousands of people were displaced during the storm, and moved into evacuation shelters set up by the government. In eastern Hualien County, 250 houses succumbed to strong winds. The winds also felled trees and blew light vehicles around, blocking roads. Heavy rainfall associated with Bilis flooded roughly 40,000 ha of orchards and rice paddies. Following Bilis' passage of Taiwan, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck the island, exacerbating the already worsened conditions."
 taiwan.2.a: "Time to rebuild."
 taiwan.3.t: "Taiwan presidential election"
 taiwan.3.d: "Its the second ever direct presidential election of the Republic of China, to elect the 10th-term President and Vice-President of the Republic of China under the 1947 Constitution. This has the potential to put an end to more than half a century of Kuomintang rule on Taiwan, since the KMT voters split in half.\n\nThough more popular and consistently ranked higher in the polls, the outspoken former Taiwan Governor James Soong failed to gain the Kuomintang's nomination. As a result, he announced his candidacy as an independent candidate. The Kuomintang responded by expelling Soong and 21 of his allies. They sued Soong for theft, alleging that as party Secretary-General, he stole millions of Taiwan dollars in cash intended for the family of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo and hid the money in the Chunghsing Bills Finance Co. Soong defended himself by saying he was acting under Lee's direction, but his story was largely unpersuasive. Initially holding a commanding lead in the polls, Soong lost by just over 300,000 votes, and the financial scandal that tarnished his image as a clean politician will likely led to his failure.\n\nThe Democratic Progressive Party run former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian for president. Having run for the 1996 election on a radical independence platform and lost by a landslide, the DPP in May 1999 moderated its stance by issuing the \"Resolution on the Future of Taiwan.\" The resolution accepted the status quo and promoted the moderate view that Taiwan was already independent, so any formal declaration would not be urgently necessary, if at all. Also included was the pledge that any change in Taiwan's international status will have to be done through a referendum, thus alleviating the fear that, if elected, a DPP government would unilaterally declare independence without popular approval. The Chen-Lu ticket also promises to be more aggressive in fighting black gold, to provide more funding for social services, and to be more environmentally friendly, such as opposition to nuclear power."

 taiwan.4.t: "Coast Guard Administration established"
 taiwan.4.d: "The CGA combines the Coast Guard Command, the Marine Police Bureau, and several cutters from the Taiwan Directorate General of Customs, Ministry of Finance. The CGA formally unifies coastal and maritime law enforcement agencies. It will see a great deal of action for a young agency, participating in numerous search and rescue and anti-smuggling operations in the near future.\n\nThe Coast Guard Administration of the Ocean Affairs Council (CGA) is charged with maintaining law and order, protecting the resources of the territorial waters of the ROC, which surrounds Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu Islands, Green Island, Orchid Island, Dongsha Islands, and Nansha Islands as well as providing a first line of defense along coastal areas against smugglers and illegal immigrants. The CGA is considered a civilian law enforcement agency under the administration of Ocean Affairs Council of the Executive Yuan, though during emergencies it may be incorporated as part of the Republic of China Armed Forces.\n\nThe Coast Guard Administration is headed by one minister and three deputy ministers. The CGA includes eight departments, one office and five task forces, as well as a Maritime Patrol Directorate General and a Coastal Patrol Directorate General. Its jurisdiction covers the waters surrounding Kinmen, Matsu, Penghu, and the main island of Taiwan to ensure proper protection of the 1,819.8 kilometers coastline and 540,000 square kilometers of \"Blue Territory,\" which is 15 times larger than the island of Taiwan."

Among these departments, Asia-Pacific Industrial and Business Management is especially designed for cultivating industrial elites.\n\nAn unusual feature in this school is its open space. There are no walls on the boundaries of the campus. Residents who live around this school can walk to campus or exercise by using equipment in the gym. Biodiversity is also a notable characteristic of NUK. There are more than 60 sorts of fish in pond of the Water Land Park."

 taiwan.8.t: "The Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement has been Ratified"
 taiwan.8.d: "Following its approval by the Taiwanese legislature, the CSSTA, a free-trade agreement between Taiwan and mainland China, has officially entered Taiwanese law. This agreement marks a serious improvement in relations between the two parties, and will significantly improve cross-strait trade in services. However, critics of the deal remain unconvinced that it poses no threat to Taiwan's political autonomy from China."

 taiwan.10.d: "[CHI.GetLeader]'s government has offered us a \"Roadmap to Reunification\" mapping out a path for Taiwan to eventually return to Chinese control as a Special Administrative Region. The proposal includes multiple safeguards for the continuation of Taiwanese democracy and political autonomy, but this may not be enough for Taiwanese opponents to reunification with the mainland. How China might respond if we reject this plan remains uncertain."

 taiwan.12.d: "A faction of Taiwanese military officers have started seizing key locations across the island of Taiwan. [TAI.Getleader] has declared a national emergency and has mobilized those who remain loyal to the government. It remains to be seen whether the President's efforts will be successful.\n\nWhile the stated aim of the leaders of the coup is to address dissatisfaction with the [TAI.GetLeader] administration, many of the high-profile figures involved have close ties to China. Despite this, the extent of China's involvement in this coup attempt remains unclear."
 taiwan.12.a: "Taiwan's future hangs in the balance."
 taiwan.13.t: "The Taiwanese Coup has Succeeded"
 taiwan.13.d: "Following [TAI.Getleader]'s failed attempt to rally support against the coup, military officers loyal to the pro-Chinese faction in Taiwan have taken control of the country. While the officers have promised an eventual return to democracy, Taiwan's political autonomy from the mainland is undoubtedly in jeopardy. With China's unspoken but widely known support for the coup, the likelihood of a Security Council Resolution in response to this event is highly improbably."
 taiwan.13.a: "A new era in Taiwanese history."
 taiwan.14.t: "The Taiwanese Coup has Failed"
 taiwan.14.d: "[TAI.Getleader] emerged triumphant today as the last participants in the coup surrendered to Taiwanese police. The last 2 weeks saw a failure by the coup-plotters to win the support of the people or their fellow soldiers. This lack of support contributed to existing deficiencies in resources and morale, leading to pro-coup troops around the country surrendering to the authorities en masse. [TAI.Getleader] assured journalists that stability and calm would quickly be restored to the island nation, while China has yet to comment on recent events."
 taiwan.14.a: "Crisis has been averted."

 taiwan.15.t: "China Demands an End to the Taiwan Relations Act!"
 taiwan.15.d: "The PRC has demanded that we revoke the Taiwan Relations Act that enshrines our current relationship with the governing authorities of Taiwan. This demand is undoubtedly a prelude to even more aggressive action towards Taiwan than what we have already seen in recent months.

 taiwan.15.b: "It is better for us to concede..."

 taiwan.18.d: "With the stated aim of frustrating Chinese attempts to interfere in Taiwan's electoral process, [TAI.GetLeader] has managed to pass a controversial \"anti-infiltration bill\" in parliament. The bill bans hostile foreign powers from campaigning, lobbying, making political donations or spreading disinformation. Opposition lawmakers have strongly opposed the bill as has Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office. Both lambasted [TAI.GetLeader] as perpetrating a \"Green Terror\" that contributes to an atmosphere of paranoia and fear. [TAI.GetLeader]'s ruling party has defended the move as a necessary act given the substantial threat that mainland China poses to the island territory."

 hongkong.9.t: "Hong Kong Protests Fizzle Out"
 hongkong.9.d: "Protests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region against recent Chinese actions have gradually declined in recent days and have virtually come to a stop. Police operations in the Chinese territory have met with no resistance, and many who had previously taken to the streets have returned to their homes. What this means for the relationship between China and a troubled territory that holds significant different political values from the former remain to be seen. Perhaps one indicator for what is to come was a banner left by protesters in a prominent location in the city center which read \"We will be back\"."
 hongkong.9.a: "An interesting development."
 hongkong.9.b: "They know their cause is futile."

 hongkong.10.t: "Hong Kong Protests Increase in Scale"
 hongkong.10.d: "Protests against Chinese actions in the territory of Hong Kong have rapidly increased, with analysts widely agreeing that the protests have entered a new stage in terms of scale and tactics. How the Chinese and Hong Kong governments will respond to this new escalation remains to be seen, but officials in both governments are reportedly increasingly resentful of the impacts of the protests on their vested interests. The protesters, for their part, are refusing to stand down until the Chinese and Hong Kong governments address their demands."
 hongkong.10.a: "The Hong Kong people will not stay quiet..."
 hongkong.10.b: "They will stay home if they know what's good for them!"

 #Korea
 korea.1.t: "China Demands Our Withdrawal from the Korean Peninsula"
 korea.1.d: "The PRC has demanded that we withdraw our troops protecting the Republic of Korea from what it describes as its \"sphere of influence\". This demand is undoubtedly a prelude to aggressive action towards the ROK. If we pull our troops out of the Peninsula, the chances of a conflict across the DMZ will rise dramatically."
 korea.1.a: "This demand is ludicrous!"
 korea.1.b: "It is better for us to concede..."

 korea.2.t: "China is encouraging us to initiate economic reforms"
 korea.2.d: "[CHI.GetLeader] is urging our government to follow China's lead and initiate market liberalization reforms. While experiencing the same rapid economic growth as China did in the 1980s is a tempting proposition, we should weigh this against the instability that would inevitably result from our pursuit of such reforms."
 korea.2.a: "Now is not the time for reform!"
 korea.2.b: "Initiate minor reforms."
 korea.2.c: "Initiate moderate reforms."
 korea.2.e: "Initiate major reforms."

 korea.3.t: "[NKO.GetLeader] has announced fresh economic reforms"
 korea.3.d: "Under Chinese pressure to reform, North Korea has begun a process of economic liberalization that many hope will raise living standards in the \"hermit kingdom\". While many economists have lauded the beginning of this reform process, others have raised concerns about whether the speed of reform may cause instability in a country that has become adjusted to a completely planned economy."
 korea.3.a: "Encouraging news?"

 korea.4.t: "The Chinese-North Korean Split"
 korea.4.d: "Criticisms of [NKO.GetLeader]'s regime in Chinese government-linked media have increased dramatically in recent weeks. These criticisms have attacked North Korea's continued nuclear problem and the North Korean state's failure to improve the livelihoods of its citizens through economic liberalization as China has done in recent decades.\n\nWhile [CHI.GetLeader] has remained silent on the issue, it is widely believed that these media organizations would not have launched such a scathing critique of a once close ally without [CHI.GetLeader]'s tacit approval. Many observers see this as a culmination of Chinese frustration with the Kim dynasty, and possibly a desire for the establishment of an alternative government that is more stable and compliant with China's wishes."
 korea.4.a: "Only [CHI.GetLeader] knows where this going..."

 korea.5.t: "The Talks Begin"
 korea.5.d: "The primary demand of the North is that we cease our joint military exercises with the United States, exercises that they see as preparations for an invasion of their territory. However, these exercises are widely viewed by our military as necessary preparations in case of a North Korean attack. Agreeing to stop these exercises would therefore be a significant gamble, one where our country's security is put on the line."
 korea.5.d_NKO: "The primary demand of the South is that we cease our nuclear weapons tests, tests that they see as evidence of our aggressive intentions. However, our nuclear weapons program is viewed by the military as an important deterrent against US invasion. Moreover, the program and the tests that are necessary for its continuation help bolster the legitimacy of our government. Agreeing to stop these tests would therefore be a significant gamble, one where both our country and our government's security is put on the line."
 korea.5.a: "Our country will never be whole again unless we take a few risks..."
 korea.5.b: "Some risks are too big too take."

 korea.6.t: "Korean Peace Talks Begin"
 korea.6.d: "For over half a century North and South Korea have technically been in a state of war. This frozen conflict has occasionally heated up with clashes between the two sides along disputed maritime boundaries or across the DMZ. Now the two sides are coming together in the hope of bringing about an end to this state of affairs and achieve de-escalation on the Korean peninsula through a formal peace treaty. Negotiating a peace treaty is widely seen as an important first step towards reunifying the Korean peninsula."
 korea.6.a: "Can the two sides reach a compromise?"

 korea.7.t: "[CHI.GetLeader] Voices Support for Korean Reunification"
 korea.7.d: "China has historically been wary of the prospect of a united Korea aligned with the United States on its doorstep. Observers were therefore surprised to hear [CHI.GetLeader] voice unequivocal support for reunification, in a move that by some accounts has caught the North Korean leadership off guard. Given China's substantial influence in both Koreas, this announcement is likely to pressure the two sides to come to the negotiation table."
 korea.7.a: "Is change in the air?"


 korea.38.t: "Russia is encouraging us to initiate economic reforms"
 korea.38.d: "[SOV.GetLeader] is urging our government to initiate western market liberalization reforms. While experiencing the same rapid economic growth as China did in the 1980s is a tempting proposition, we should weigh this against the instability that would inevitably result from our pursuit of such reforms."
 korea.38.a: "Now is not the time for reform!"
 korea.38.b: "Initiate minor reforms."
 korea.38.c: "Initiate moderate reforms."
 korea.38.e: "Initiate major reforms."
 #Cyber Warfare
 cyber.1.t: "Our Cyber Security Infrastructure is Falling Behind Global Standards!"

 cyber.2.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Hackers have Stolen Classified Military Intelligence!"

 cyber.4.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Hackers have Failed to Breach our Defences!"

 cyber.4.a: "Our investments in cyber security have paid off."

 cyber.5.t: "We have successfully targeted Taiwanese citizens with our propaganda!"
 cyber.5.d: "Now that we have managed to infiltrate social media websites and forums used by people from this country, we can choose whether we wish to use this propaganda to increase our influence in the country or to manipulate the country's politics."

 recognition.5.t: "[FROM.GetName] Recognizes the Legitimacy of Our Government!"
 recognition.5.d: "No doubt in recognition of our right to represent our people, the government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has cut off ties with our rival and established ties with our government. This represents a significant step forward in the struggle against our rivals to represent the voice of our people in the international arena."
 recognition.5.a: "Our enemies grow weaker!"

 recognition.6.t: "[FROM.GetName] No Longer Recognizes Our Government!"
 recognition.6.d: "A blow to our international position has been dealt by the government of [FROM.GetNameDef] against the wishes of our people.

 #News
 KurdistanNews.1.t: "Kurdistan Rejoins Iraq"
 KurdistanNews.1.d: "During the apex of ISIS, Kurdistan started slowly shifting away from Iraq and becoming more independent. Now that ISIS has been defeated, the Kurdistan Regional Government seems to have made a full turn and expressed wishes to start working again together with the Iraqi federal government. Many speculated that the Kurds would be aiming for independence, but it seems they've decided to decide otherwise, possibly fearing repercussions from their neighbours."
 KurdistanNews.1.a: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.2.t: "The Kurdish Independence Referendum"
 KurdistanNews.2.d: "The Kurdish Regional Government has announced that it will be holding an independence referendum in the areas that they currently control. The move has been seen as controversial, given that the referendum is being held in areas that aren't officially part of the Kurdish Autonomous Region but the Federal State of Iraq, including the major city of Kirkuk.\n\nMany see this as nothing more than a land-grab by the Kurds, while others argue that the Kurds have earned their right to independence after effectively saving Iraq from ISIS. Even though the KRG claims that the results will be non-binding, many fear that it will lead to full independence and possibly a new conflict in Iraq."
 KurdistanNews.2.a: "They have no right to do this!"
 KurdistanNews.2.b: "Let's see how this play out."
 KurdistanNews.3.t: "Kurdish Independence Referendum Succeeds"
 KurdistanNews.3.d: "The Kurdish Independence Referendum was a resounding success for the Kurdish government. With a 93% vote of 'Yes' option with a 72% voter turnout, Kurdish people everywhere rejoice. Due to the success of the referendum, the Kurdish government decided to declare full independence from the Iraqi Federal Government. Surprisingly, the Iraqi government agreed to the request."
 KurdistanNews.3.a: "The Kurds need to be stopped."
 KurdistanNews.3.b: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.4.t: "Kurdish Independence Referendum Succeeds"
 KurdistanNews.4.d: "The Kurdish Independence Referendum was a resounding success for the Kurdish government. With a 93% vote of 'Yes' option with a 72% voter turnout, Kurdish people everywhere rejoice. Due to the success of the referendum, the Kurdish government decided to demand more autonomy from the Iraqi Federal Government. Surprisingly, the Iraqi government agreed to the request."
 KurdistanNews.4.a: "The Kurds need to be stopped."
 KurdistanNews.4.b: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.5.t: "Iraq Captures Kirkuk"
 KurdistanNews.5.d: "As the negotiations between Iraq and Kurdistan broke down, Iraqi forces moved to capture the city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds had captured from ISIS earlier. As the Iraqi forces approached Kirkuk, most elements of the Peshmerga retreated from the city without a fight. Some independent elements of the Kurdish forces stayed and tried to set up a defence of the city, but were quickly overwhelmed by the Iraqis. In just two days, the Iraqi forces had regained full control of the city, most of it without any fighting."
 KurdistanNews.5.a: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.6.t: "Iraq Captures Kirkuk"
 KurdistanNews.6.d: "As the negotiations between Iraq and Kurdistan broke down, Iraqi forces moved to capture the city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds had captured from ISIS earlier. As the Iraqi forces approached the city, Kurdish forces took up defensive positions, with main defenses being at the K1 military base and the Kirkuk-Takrit Road.\n\nDespite strong defence, the Iraqi 9th Armoured Division managed capture the military base and advance towards the Northern oil field of Baba Gurgur, while the Popular Mobilisation Forces tied down Kurdish troops in the city itself. Fearing encirclement, the Kurdish forces started retreating from the city, some under orders and some on their own. After a few days of fighting, Iraq was fully in control of the city."
 KurdistanNews.6.a: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.7.t: "Kurdistan Defends Kirkuk"
 KurdistanNews.7.d: "As the negotiations between Iraq and Kurdistan broke down, Iraqi forces moved to capture the city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds had captured from ISIS earlier. As the Iraqi forces approached the city, Kurdish forces took up defensive positions, with main defenses being at the K1 military base and the Kirkuk-Takrit Road.\n\nIraqi 9th Armoured Division split their forces in two, as they attacked both the military base and the city itself through its Southern suburbs. At the same time, the Popular Mobilisation Forces attacked in the centre towards Kirkuk Airfield. As the 9th Armoured Division got bogged down in the suburbs, the Kurdish forces managed to conduct a flanking attack against the PMF forces, forcing them to retreat. With the centre destroyed, the separated elements of the 9th Armoured Division were soon forced to retreat as well. The Battle of Kirkuk proved to be disastrous for the Iraqi forces, while the morale of the Kurds was greatly boosted."
 KurdistanNews.7.a: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.8.t: "Kurdistan Submits to Iraq"
 KurdistanNews.8.d: "After their victory in Kirkuk, Iraq has increased pressure towards Kurdistan. In a recent move, Iraq demanded that Kurdistan abandon all ideas of independence or increased autonomy. Having left without a choice, the Kurdish government agreed to the demands to prevent any more bloodshed."
 KurdistanNews.8.a: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.9.t: "Kurdistan Resists Iraq"
 KurdistanNews.9.d: "After their victory in Kirkuk, Iraq has increased pressure towards Kurdistan. In a recent move, Iraq demanded that Kurdistan abandon all ideas of independence or increased autonomy. The Kurdish government responded that Iraq has already shown its hostility against the Kurdish people, and at such they have no reason to agree to the demands of bullies. This might spark a new civil war in Iraq"
 KurdistanNews.9.a: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.10.t: "Iraq Moves Against Kurdistan"
 KurdistanNews.10.d: "The defeat at Kirkuk was a massive humiliation to Iraq. As a response to this, it seems they are preparing for a full-scale invasion of Kurdistan in order to bring back the breakaway state back under Iraqi control."
 KurdistanNews.10.a: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.11.t: "Iraq Withdraws into Isolation"
 KurdistanNews.11.d: "The defeat at Kirkuk was a massive humiliation to Iraq. It seems that the defeat completely demotivated Iraq from any hostility towards the Kurds. The Kurds have won their demands through blood."
 KurdistanNews.11.a: "Interesting."

 #Yemeni Events

 Yemen.4.t: "The War in Yemen has Ended"
 Yemen.4.d: "With the country in ruin, the Yemeni Civil War has finally concluded, granting victory to the Hadi-led government, backed by the Saudi Coalition. In the final days of the conflict, coalition forces managed to capture and destroy Houthi and Al-Qaeda ammo dumps, including the infamous Burkan 2-H scud missiles. Though many may still hold their loyalties to the Houthis, they have been disarmed, and in the coming days, the remaining Zaydi radicals will be rooted out and dealt with. Democracy has prevailed in the region with the help of the Saudi coalition and it's campaign, Restoring Hope, and the country of Yemen is on it's way to being rebuilt."
 Yemen.4.d2: "With the Hadi-led government reduced to rubble, the Houthi cause has found itself at the forefront of Yemen's future leadership. As was their goal, the Houthi's have managed to drive salafism and devotion to western ideologies from the region, and those who fought for it, as the Al-Qaeda and coalition forces lie in ruin. Now with the full responsibility of leading Yemen into the future, the Houthi government has begun the process of transforming from it's interrim state, and they have now embarked on the path of rebuilding the country. The Saudi coalition has withdrawn from the region, and has rendered Operation Restoring Hope, a complete and utter failure."
 Yemen.4.d3: "After years of fighting between the Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels, the most unlikely of all victors has emerged from the conflict. The remnants of Al-Qaeda in Yemen have found themselves as the architect of a new caliphate in the region, and have undergone a transformation for the future that will put all infidels in the region in danger. The Saudi coalition and Operation Restoring Hope has been a complete failure, and it's incompetence has failed to predict it's own defeat to an enemy it never new was this serious. The Jihadis have prevailed, and they have made it clear that this is only the beginning, and the rest of the world will soon realize what this new caliphate can do."
 Yemen.4.a: "Victory is finally ours..."
 Yemen.4.b: "But at what cost?"
 Yemen.4.c: "It could have been worse..."
 Yemen.4.e: "Interesting."
 Yemen.4.f: "Interesting."

 Yemen.6.t: "Fire missile at Riyadh?"
 Yemen.6.d: "Shooting a missile at the Saudi Capital will show the Saudis we're a force to be reckoned with."
 Yemen.6.a: "Do it!"
 Yemen.6.b: "Too dangerous."

 Yemen.7.t: "Houthis fire ballistic missile at Riyadh"
 Yemen.7.d: "Saudi-led coalition battling Yemen's Houthi rebels says it has intercepted a missile fired from the neighbouring country towards the kingdom's capital, Riyadh. Houthi rebels said on Tuesday they had launched a ballistic missile targeting al-Yamama royal palace to mark 1,000 days since the coalition started its bombing campaign in Yemen."
 Yemen.7.a: "Uh oh..."

 Saleh.1.t: "The Houthi Power Struggle"
 Saleh.1.d: "The unlikely alliance between the Houthi rebels and Ali Abdullah Saleh's General People's Congress, has been on shaky ground since the day it was conceived. With help from our coalition members operating inside Yemen, we've discovered that former President Saleh has a growing discontent for the Houthi leadership, and rightly so. The Houthis oppose being effectively controlled by foreign powers, and seek to restore Yemen as it's own, completely independent entity free of salafism and western ideals. Saleh on the other hand, wants to restore Yemen as a free, united and democratic country, eager to participate in foreign affairs to an extent, though he does have his reasons to resent a number of western nations. This relationship is bound to boil over into a future conflict between the two parties, and it may be what the coalition needs."
 Saleh.1.a: "We don't have time for this..."
 Saleh.1.b: "Get President Saleh on the phone..."

 Saleh.2.t: "Saleh Suggests Coalition Dialogue"
 Saleh.2.d: "Ali Abdullah Saleh, the head of the General People's Congress aligned with the Houthi cause, is suggesting that the GPC and Houthi leadership open up talks with the Saudi-led coalition currently operating alongside President Hadi's Yemen. Though we very narrowly consider him an ally, it appears he has had a change of heart, and not in a good way. He now sternly suggests that the Houthi leadership come to a decision on whether or not this brutal civil war should continue. The likelihood of us coming out of these talks with something to gain is very small, and it could all very well be a ploy to remove us from power."
 Saleh.2.a: "Absolutely not!"
 Saleh.2.b: "It couldn't hurt..."

 Saleh.3.t: "Houthi Leaders are Willing to Talk"
 Saleh.3.d: "After pressure from the former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, the leaders of the Houthi insurgents in Sana'a are willing to try to come to terms with Hadi and our coalition."
 Saleh.3.a: "Well then, gather the coalition."
 Saleh.3.b: "This probably isn't a good idea..."

 Saleh.5.t: "Saleh Embarks on a Dangerous Path"
 Saleh.5.d: "After years of an indecisive and unstable alliance between Houthi and Republican forces, former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, held a speech directed at the Saudi-led coalition highlighting the so-called stupidity of the Houthi cause. Saleh stated that if the coalition were to lift their blockade and open the airports to ease the humanitarian effort, him and his republican forces were willing to pledge their allegiance to Saudi Arabia, declaring himself an enemy of our alliance. Saleh appeared fully committed in his most recent speech, and publicly declared a new chapter in Yemen's history amidst this humanitarian crisis, as a united, free and democratic Yemen. The words of Saleh - I am going to fight the enemies of humanity and the enemies of our homeland who are trying hard to erase its identity and destroy its gains and humiliate the Yemenis!"
 Saleh.5.a: "Find this traitor..."
 Saleh.5.b: "He doesn't have the guts to do it..."

 Saleh.6.t: "Saleh is On The Run"
 Saleh.6.d: "After giving a series of treacherous speeches, Ali Abdullah Saleh has made it clear he no longer wishes to work alongside the Houthis. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi knew of Saleh's approaching treachery, and he issued several warnings to him, all of which were not heeded. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi declared this as a treasonous act, which subsequently led to Saleh's home in Sana'a being destroyed by Houthi mortar fire, and he is now fleeing the country. Houthi fighters have been hot on his trail, and they've managed to drive him into a potentially fatal trap south of Sana'a, where combat between the Houthi's and the coalition still rages. A number of fighters manning the front are prepared to pull back and intervene on your command."
 Saleh.6.a: "Pull the trigger..."
 Saleh.6.b: "Let him go..."

 Saleh.7.t: "The Supreme Political Council"
 Saleh.7.d: "With the war won, the time has come to rebuild our country that we fought so desperately to free from it's misguided leadership. Our associates from the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, an interim government that we had put in place amidst the civil war, remind us of their contribution to the war effort and urge us to carry out our original plan of dividing our presidential council equally between both parties. Let us remember that a number of these men were among those we started this fight against, and those we could not maintain a stable alliance with. We cannot foresee the future, but allowing them a seat in our parliament may very well lead us back into the uncertainty we sought to destroy."
 Saleh.7.a: "We fought to achieve this position, and we will fight to defend it."
 Saleh.7.b: "Nonsense, we will rebuild our nation together."

 Saleh.8.t: "Houthi Leadership Denies Saleh's Suggestion"
 Saleh.8.d: "After our talk with former Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, he made an effort to convince the Houthi leadership to come to a conclusion on whether or not this war of theirs should continue. As we expected, he was rejected without a second thought. The Houthis appear to be beyond adamant on the topic of continuing their war effort to overthrow the democratic government of Yemen. This has worn on on the alliance between Saleh's General People's Congress and the Houthi rebels, and if we push Saleh harder, he may be willing to finally severe ties with the misguided cause."
 Saleh.8.a: "We must try harder!"
 Saleh.8.b: "Forget it..."

 Saleh.9.t: "Saleh Persists"
 Saleh.9.d: "Ali Abdullah Saleh once again, suggests that we open up talks with the Saudi-led coalition, who I must remind you, is our enemy. It is true that our alliance with the GPC has always been in a critical state, but this persistence by Saleh has not appeared out of thin air, he must have a motive. It would not be crazy to believe that the Saudi-led coalition is in contact with him, we must watch this closely."
 Saleh.9.a: "This might actually be a good idea..."
 Saleh.9.b: "Ali, stop this immediately, or else."
 Saleh.9.c: "Mr. Saleh, may I have a word with you?"

 HOU_Saleh.1: "Ali Abdullah Saleh will be pursued by Houthi fighters."
 HOU_Saleh.2: "Ali Abdullah Saleh will be contacted about bringing the Yemeni Civil War to an end, with our help. Whether that be through diplomacy or brute force, we must convince him to attend a dialogue with our coalition."
 HOU_Saleh.3: "Our alliance has never been as strong as would be ideal, but I do value our allegiance, though it may not seem this way. I understand that you want a conclusion to this war, but unfortunately I cannot allow myself or my comrades to deal with this devil of a coalition. Surely you understand?"
 HOU_Saleh.4: "Ali is disappointed."
 HOU_Saleh.5: "Ali will be contacted once more."
 HOU_Saleh.6: "Ali visibly recoils, and exits the room."
 HOU_Saleh.7: "Ali will be contacted again, but let this be the final warning to him that if he remains aligned with our enemy, he too will be treated as an enemy."

 Saleh.10.t: "Saleh is Wasting Our Time..."
 Saleh.10.d: "Once again, the leader of the General People's Congress aligned with the Houthi rebels,  Ali Abdullah Saleh, was denied by the Houthi leadership to commence peace talks with our coalition. It has been clear from the beginning that the Houthi leadership will not speak with us, as they see us as a sworn enemy. With the GPC-Houthi alliance as critical as it is, we must deliver Ali Abdullah Saleh an ultimatum immediately. Without him, the Houthis governing parties will be in shambles without proper skill and talent behind it. With him, the leadership has competence, though it lacks a certain ability when it comes to progress, but it could potentially carry the Houthis to victory."
 Saleh.10.a: "He either takes action, or we cannot guarantee his safety."
 Saleh.10.b: "This is pointless..."

 Saleh.11.t: "The General People's Congress Defects!"
 Saleh.11.d: "Even after numerous occasions in which Saleh's Republican forces have exchanged fire with ours, we've formally remained allies. No longer, these traitors have officially declared themselves as our enemy after their treasonous leader, Ali Abdullah Saleh, was rightfully disposed of. The GPC and it's troops are actively engaging in firefights with us in the streets of our cities, we must put a stop to this at once."
 Saleh.11.a: "Traitors! I should have seen this coming!"

 Saleh.12.t: "Former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh Assassinated!"
 Saleh.12.d: "This day is considered a major victory for the Houthi cause, as the man who sought to tear them apart from the inside, has now been defeated. It was long believed by the Houthis that Saleh had been in contact with the Saudi-led coalition, but it wasn't until recently that Mr. Saleh had shown his true colors to the Houthis, and attempted to side with the coalition by declaring a new chapter of unification and democracy in Yemen. This struck a great ire in the Houthis, and with Saleh gone, they claim that their morale is soaring."
 Saleh.12.a: "Good work boys."
 Saleh.12.b: "This is troubling..."
 Saleh.12.c: "Interesting."

 Saleh.13.t: "Saleh Renews GPC-Houthi Alliance"
 Saleh.13.d: "The leader of the General People's Congress, a long-time Houthi ally, though not on the greatest of terms, has declared a renewal of the once divided alliance. Ali Abdullah Saleh publically announced a new chapter in Yemen's future, a chapter in which the GPC and Houthis will work together to restore the ruined nation. Saleh gave one condition, and that was that the Houthi leadership formalizes the Supreme Political Council, an interim government put in place in the time of war, and split the rulership between the two alliances, as was originally planned."
 Saleh.13.a: "Is this good? I can't tell."
 Saleh.13.b: "Damn!"

 Saleh.14.t: "The Coalition Gathers"
 Saleh.14.d: "The Houthi leadership opposing the democratic, Hadi-led government in Yemen, has shown that they are willing to come to the table and talk about the humanitarian situation currently ongoing in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, the leader of the coalition operating in Yemen, has invited all of it's members to a diplomatic summit being held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The special guests will be Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi himself, along with his associate, Ali Abdullah Saleh."
 Saleh.14.a: "We must attend."
 Saleh.14.b: "Sorry, we don't have time for this."
 Saleh.14.c: "We would be honoured to host this summit."

 Saleh.15.t: "The Summit Commences"
 Saleh.15.d: "Those that chose to attend that summit take their seats, and await the beginning of the discussion. The Houthis have mentioned that they are not coming into this discussion with the intent to just surrender, so we must sway them to see the conflict from an outsider's shoes. This war in Yemen has been one of the greatest humanitarian crises in recent memory, and it would benefit all parties for the war to be put to a halt as soon as possible. To make this quick, let us share our demands..."
 Saleh.15.a: "Surrender and return all territories to Yemen's rightful government."
 Saleh.15.b: "Cease the conflict immediately, and both states shall remain independent."
 Saleh.15.c: "All Houthi claimed land shall be declared an Arabian state."

 Saleh.16.t: "The Coalition Demands Surrender"
 Saleh.16.d: "We were invited to this summit in Abu Dhabi to discuss a potential end to the war we have been fighting for years now, and we have come to the realization that this was all a waste of time. We were immediately greeted by an absurd demand as soon as the summit had started, that demand being our full surrender. But, as long as the war still rages, people will continue to die and cities will continue to be destroyed. Ending the war may be for the better, but it would mean capitulating to our sworn enemies."
 Saleh.16.a: "This war must end, so we must oblige."
 Saleh.16.b: "Ridiculous! This discussion ends now!"

 Saleh.17.t: "The Coalition Demands both States Remain Independent"
 Saleh.17.d: ""
 Saleh.17.a: "All of Yemen is ours, or this discussion is over."

 #Central African Republic
 CentralAfricaNews.1.t: "Central African Republic Civil War Over"
 CentralAfricaNews.1.CAR.d: "The legitimate government of [CAR.GetNameDef] under [CAR.GetLeader] has managed to pacify the fringes of the country.\n\nAfter being cornered in the capital as the rest of the country fell under various militias and factions, with international support the government was able to eventually expand the rule of law back into the country. Even though the worst violence is behind them, the government will still have to work hard to remove all sectarian violence from the country."
 CentralAfricaNews.1.SEL.d: "The Seleka coalition in Central Africa has secured control of the country.\n\nThe origins of the group is in 2003, when it was formed to combat Michael Bozize's coup. After the Seleka leader Michel Djotodia was made president in 2013, the group was officially disbanded. This caused the ex-fighters to go on a reign of terror in the country, igniting the civil war.\n\nDespite being predominantly Muslim (thus representing only a tenth of the population), the group still has managed to once again gain control of the country. This will most likely create another wave of terror on the predominantly Christian population of the country."
 CentralAfricaNews.1.BAL.d: "The Anti-Balaka allince in Central Africa has gained control of the country.\n\nWhat started as a Christian militia to protect from highwaymen in the 90s, turned into an official self-protection group in 2009. The group's main purpose became to fight against the Seleka militias, who were predominantly Muslim. Like their enemies, they quickly adopted violent tactics, force converting, burning and mass executing Muslims in the country.\n\nThe group is now in full control of the country, and future prospects for the small Muslim minority are looking bleak."
 CentralAfricaNews.1.LOG.d: "The Republic of Dar El Kuti, also known as Republic of Logone, has subjugated the Central African government and the various militias roaming the country.\n\nCalling for independence for the Muslims of the country, Dar El Kuti has practically split the country in two. This might only be a short period for peace however, as many Christians still live in the new republic's borders."

This greatly upset the non-secular leadership of Al-Shabaab.\n\nDespite being driven to near defeat in 2017, the Islamist group managed to bounce back and gather support from various smaller Islamist and tribal factions, many of which were displeased with the Western-backed secular government. The Black Standard now flies over Mogadishu, and the Al-Shabaab are free to continue spreading radical Islam"

 SomaliaNews.1.t: "Al-Shabaab Defeated!"
 SomaliaNews.1.d: "The Somalian governmental forces have managed to capture the last remaining stronghold of the Islamist Al-Shabaab. Ever since the ignition of sectarian violence in 2009, the Somalian government along with its African Union allies have been fighting Al-Shabaab. Already a cornered animal by 2017, the last remaining pockets of Al-Shabaab were slowly but surely destroyed by Somalian and AMISOM forces.\n\n'Small pockets of resistance and individual terror cells still remain but they will not be a threat to the Somali government', a government spokesperson said."

 SomaliaNews.2.SNA.d: "The Somali National Alliance has managed to claim rulership over Somalia against the UN-backed Transitional National Government. [SNA.GetLeader], son of late general Mohammed Aidid, has been nominated the new president of the Republic. The fight between SNA and TNG originated from SNA's claims that the TNG was 'harboring militant Islamist sympathizers'. The new government will likely clamp down hard on the more radical elements of Somali society."
 SomaliaNews.2.Separatist.d: "The nation of Somalia delves into chaos, as various separatist groups claim victory over the government. Despite Somalia being an ethnically homogeneous country, clan traditions still rule strong and offer a stronger sense of identity than nationality. Several clans have declared self-rule, and a unified Somali Republic seems nothing more than a distant dream now."

 AfghanistanNews.1.TAL.d: "Despite best efforts by the Afghani Armed Forces and their Western allies, the Taliban have managed to gain full control of all the major cities, including the capital Kabul. Most government officials have gone into hiding or to exile, including the Afghani president [AFG.GetLeader] currently residing in the United States.\n\nThe triumph of the Taliban is sure to increase the frequency of terror attack in the region and worldwide."
 AfghanistanNews.1.AFG.d: "The Afghani government have declared victory of the Taliban. The majority of strongest outposts and cities have been cleared of their presence, and most of what fighters remain have escaped across the border into Pakistan. Though the Taliban are reduced to only a few pockets and cells, the insurgency is projected to last for many years to come, albeit at lower levels.\n\nThis victory has shown the effectiveness of the rebuilt Afghani Army, and the resolve of the Afghani government."

 #Egypt
 Egypt.1.t: "El-Kosheh Massacre"
 Egypt.1.d: "The el-Kosheh Massacre was a terrorist attack that occurred on Sunday, January 2 in the village el-Kosheh in Upper Egypt, 450 kilometers south of Cairo.\n\nThe Coptic Christian minority living in North Eastern Africa has always had a difficult relationship with radical Muslims living among the Islamic majority populations. el-Kosheh was a local economic center in Sohag governorate with a population of about 35,000 and a majority Coptic population - a fact that did not save the local civilians from militant attackers. After a religious conflict between a Christian shop owner and a Muslim customer, the Muslim community of the village was outraged into a frenzy and began looting and pillaging Christian shops and storefronts, mainly in the outskirts of the city in el-Kosheh village, a good distance away from the city of Kosheh.\n\nThis massacre was one of the largest in Egypt's history and calls the efficiency of our majority-Muslim government into action. The pope of the Coptic church has already called this a tragedy of martyrdom and declared the 21 massacred Christian martyrs. What should the government of Egypt do?"
 Egypt.1.a: "We will track these bastards down."

 european_union.1.o1: "We approve."
 european_union.1.o2: "Veto!"
 european_union.2.t: "We have been vetoed!"

 european_union.2.o1: "It was worth the try."
 european_union.3.t: "Unite the Union!"
 european_union.3.d: "It is time. All paperwork has been done, all treaties are on the table. We can now send invitations to all EU member states to form one big, glorious and invincible Federation."
 european_union.3.o1: "This is Europe's finest hour!"
 european_union.4.t: "Call to join the EU Federalization"
 european_union.4.d: "The European Union in the past has done everything to drive its member states closer to each other. It guaranteed us peace, economic prosperity and greater freedom for our citizens. But now, the EU is asking us to do the next step: One of the countries has initiated the process to Unite the EU."
 european_union.4.o1: "In varietate concordia!"
 european_union.4.o2: "Give up our sovereignity? Rather not."
 european_union.5.t: "Invitation to the European Union"
 european_union.5.d: "Due to recent bureaucratic reforms within the European Union, it now views us as a valid partner. One of the major European powers has called for us to join the economic alliance. Our people are split on the issue and our decision could go either way."
 european_union.5.o1: "In varietate concordia!"
 european_union.5.o2: "This is not our goal right now."
 european_union.6.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Investments"
 european_union.6.d: "The deal behind the European Union is simple: Larger European economies help the smaller ones develop and, in exchange, gain a larger market and a greater amount of possible consumers. Industrialists from [From.GetName] have visited [Root.GetAdjective] facilities today and have made agreements to improve our political and economic infrastructure."

 european_union.8.o1: "It would have been nice to have them."
 european_union.10.t: "Abandoning the EU"
 european_union.10.d2: "The European Union holds us and our fellow sovereign European states back from greatness. The members of our government grow increasingly upset with the European attitude towards our national sovereignty and the ease with which European delegates do whatever the United States tells them to do.\n\nWe need to quit. This is unacceptable. They can kiss American asses all they want, but they will have to do that without us."
 european_union.10.d3: "While monarchies are not technically banned from joining the European Union, they have to have petty little things like parliaments or elections - which the grand system around [This.GetLeader] thankfully is devoid of. This however has lead to a precarious spot for us, being asked to either hold general elections within the next week or be expelled from the halls.\n\nWell, we won't hold elections, that much is certain, so it seems they will have to play their little 'democracy' game without us."
 european_union.10.d4: "With a right-wing political party now in power, the democratic character and economic benefit of the European Union has been increasingly called into question.\n\nThe [This.GetRulingParty] delegates are split on the issue: The ideological hardliners want to leave the union no matter the consequences, while the economically liberal faction points to the number of jobs created by the EU and the political stability it brings to the continent.\n\nAny decision will be controversial, as the populous is split on the issue. Will the EU carry on without us - or should we stay?"
 european_union.10.d5: "The European Union is nothing but a bunch of capitalists that try to conquer the world for capitalism. Our brave [This.GetAdjective] delegates have stood up for the working people in every session they attended, but they are outvoted on almost any issue - when asking to disown the super rich across Europe, the delegation was even kicked from the hall! Well, maybe they should not have attacked three other delegations while their speaker was trying to argue with them, but still!\n\nThis is completely unacceptable. We can no longer carry this farce of a conglomerate. Without us!"
 european_union.10.d6: "Even [This.GetLeader] has remarked that the European Union is really 'nothing but a bunch of infidels' when talking to a conservative Islamic newspaper last week. Because of this, calls to leave the EU have gotten louder the country over - and inside the European Union. 'If you don't respect our holy halls, leave!', the president of the European Parliament shouted at our delegation today. After one of our delegates remarked that there is nothing holy except for Allah, he was kicked from the hall.\n\nThe EU has run its course for our nation. We are thankful for their cooperation, but their hedonism and worldly intrigue is unacceptable. They will have to play their stupid games without us."
 european_union.10.o1: "Without us indeed."
 european_union.10.o2: "Maybe we should stay after all."
 european_union.15.t: "The End of the European Union"
 european_union.15.d: "The EU has fallen. The institutions in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg have been abandoned indefinitely and the politicians once representing their nations in the European Parliament have been sent home and told to help their people in their own countries again."
 european_union.15.o1: "Everything comes to an end."
 european_union.16.t: "The Euro"
 european_union.16.d: "Plans for a common European currency have been around since the foundation of the European Union in 1992.\nThe project comes to fruition ten years later, with the creation of the Euro, guided by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nGiving up national authority over our currency might have downsides, but the economic benefits of trading with our neighbors and partners might just outweigh them.\nBritish, Danish and Swedish delegations have already voiced concerns and demanded a possibility of an opt-out for their respective country; which is why they refused to participate in the initial digital introduction of the Euro in 1999. What should our policy be?"
 european_union.16.o1: "An excellent proposal!"
 european_union.16.o2: "We want an opt-out."
 european_union.17.t: "Re-Nationalize the Currency"
 european_union.17.d: "Now that we are no longer involved with the Eurozone, we have - as expected - been informed by the European Central Bank that we need to soon shift the Euro out of use in our country.\n\nIntroducing a new national currency will take quite a bit of political effort - but it has to be done."
 european_union.17.o1: "Let's get it over with."
 european_union.18.t: "Call EU military aid?"
 european_union.18.d: "We are under attack by a foreign power. As according to the EU article 42.7 - the 'mutual defense clause' - we are entitled to military assistance from all other European Union members. Should we invoke the article to call our friends to our side?"
 european_union.18.o1: "Call the EU to our side!"
 european_union.18.o2: "We don't need them."
 european_union.19.t: "[From.GetName] is in need of assistance!"
 european_union.19.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] has invoked EU article 42.7 due to the recent [From.From.GetAdjective] attack, under which all European Union members are required to come to each other's aid in the terms of military attack by a foreign force.\n\nThere is no doubt that we need to join our allies as according to the treaties we signed - but should we?"
 european_union.19.o1: "European now, European forever!"
 european_union.19.o2: "Uhhhh... how about we don't?"

 #India
 India.1.t: "IC 814 Crisis Resolved"
 India.1.d: "India Airlines Flight 814 (commonly known as IC 814) had been en route from Kathmandu, Nepal to Delhi, India on December 24th, 1999, when it was hijacked.\n\nThe hijackers took control of the airplane shortly after it left Nepali airspace and entered Indian sovereign territory. The plane went on an odyssey that was highly traumatizing and exhausting to the 176 passengers and 15 crew members held hostage.\n\nAfter touching down in Amritsar, Lahore and Dubai, the plane was finally brought to Kandahar, a Taliban-controlled city in Afghanistan. While the hijackers had left 27 hostages go in Dubai due to various and not always clear reasons, they also stabbed one of them, Rupan Katyal, to death. The aim of the Islamist terrorists that apparently belonged to the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen network was to free high-ranking Islamists imprisoned in India.\n\nThe Indian government successfully negotiated for the freedom of the hostages. All of them - except for the man that had been murdered - were brought back to India in relatively good physical health."
 India.1.a: "A shameful victory is still a victory."
 India.1.b: "We will need to implement air safety reforms."
 India.2.t: "Srinagar Market Attack"
 India.2.d: "In the morning of January 3rd, 2000, the city of Srinagar in the state of Jammu and Kashmir was hit with a horrific terrorist attack. A bomb exploded on the city market, destroying the local infrastructure, disrupting public commerce and killing 20 people, at least fourteen of which were civilians.\n\nAs is custom with terrorist attacks in the disputed region, the suspected perpetrators are pro-Pakistan Muslim separatists."
 India.2.a: "Another day in Kashmir."
 India.2.b: "Mobilize all available helpers."

 #Libya
 LibyaNews.1.t: "Second Libyan Civil War Comes to an End"
 LibyaNews.1.GNA.d: "The Second Libyan Civil War started in 2014, after the Libyan military under General Khalifa Haftar ousted the ruling government when they refused to step down after losing the elections of 2014. The supporters of the government formed a new faction, the National Salvation Government, sparking a new civil war. In 2015, the UN brokered a truce between the two factions, forming a new joint-government called the Government of National Accord. However, only a year later the peace was shattered, plunging the country into a three-way civil war.\n\nIt seems that the internationally backed Government of National Accord has managed to overcome the rebellious factions and unite the country, despite lacking the backing of the Libyan military. Being recognized by the EU and much of the Western world, this is a vast shift of balance in the region."
 LibyaNews.1.HOR.d: "The Second Libyan Civil War started in 2014, after the Libyan military under General Khalifa Haftar ousted the ruling government when they refused to step down after losing the elections of 2014.

In 2015, the UN brokered a truce between the two factions, forming a new joint-government called the Government of National Accord. However, only a year later the peace was shattered, plunging the country into a three-way civil war.\n\nIt seems that the House of Representatives with the support of General Haftar, the Libyan military and many Gaddafi-loyalists have managed to legitimize their rule over the country. Supplied and backed by Russia, Haftar has promised land for two Russian military bases in the country. This will see an increase of Russian influence in North Africa."

Composed mainly of Islamists and members of the Muslim Brotherhood, many experts claim that this victory could've only achieved by serious backing from foreign actors. Who those actors were remains unclear."
 LibyaNews.1.a: "Excellent."

 #Sierra Leone
 SierraLeoneNews.1.t: "Sierra Leonean Civil War Ends"
 SierraLeoneNews.1.SIE.d: "The Sierra Leonean government announced an official victory over the rebels today. With support from Guinea, United Kingdom and the UNAMSIL forces, the rebels of RUF and AFRC have either surrendered or fled to neighbouring Liberia. The leader of RUF, [AFR.GetLeader], was found in a hideout and arrested, and was handed to the custody of the British SAS.\n\nHe is currently awaiting his trial, being charged of multiple accounts of war crimes by the UN."
 SierraLeoneNews.1.AFR.d: "Despite help from the British and UN troops, the governmental forces of Sierra Leone have been completely driven out of the capital Freetown. Some members of the government had time to evacuate to Nigeria. Others unfortunate enough to be captured by the rebels were promptly gunned down and paraded through the streets of Freetown.\n\nSeveral days of looting has occurred after the fall of the government, as rebels across the country celebrate their victory.\n\nThe country will most likely fall to anarchy and chaos as the militias no longer have any other enemies apart from the local populace."
 SierraLeoneNews.1.a: "Interesting development."
 SierraLeone.2.t: "Our Allies in Sierra Leone Fall"
 SierraLeone.2.d: "The Government of Sierra Leone has fallen to the rebels. It seems that our intervention wasn't enough to save them. We can continue fighting the AFRC, but this will mean that we'll have to advance deep into the country to reinstall the legitimate government. On the other hand, it might be better to pull back from Sierra Leone."
 SierraLeone.2.a: "Try to negotiate peace."

 #Liberia
 LiberiaNews.1.t: "The 2nd Liberian Civil War Ends"
 LiberiaNews.1.LIB.d: "Today Charles Taylor, the dictator-president of Liberia, announced the end of LURD in Liberia. Despite the Liberian military being in shambles, and most of the work being done by Taylor's anti-terrorist units, LURD with their Guinean allies weren't able to topple his government. What remaining rebels there are have crossed the border and escaped the Guinea. It is likely that Taylor will continue the conflict with Guinea until all opposition is dealt with."
 LiberiaNews.1.LUR.d: "In a televised broadcast today, Charles Taylor announced his resignation as the president of Liberia. Shortly after, he boarded a plane to fly into exile into Nigeria, as LURD rebels danced all along the streets of Monrovia. Due to suspected war crimes, Interpol issued an arrest warrant for  Taylor. However, the Nigerian government has refused to deport Taylor, unless the request comes from the new Liberian government itself.\n\nThe new Liberian government is still in an on-going reorganisation, and it will take time until it establishes itself in Monrovia, and then in the rest of the country."
 LiberiaNews.1.a: "Interesting."
 Liberia.2.t: "Our Allies in Liberia Fall"
 Liberia.2.d: "The Taylor government has driven out the LURD rebels from Liberia.

 civil_war_debuff.1.d: "The initial shock of the civil war sent our nation into complete chaos. We lost contact with some of our military units and our commanders, our supply depot responsibles stop responding and we didn't really even know where our enemy was. The fronts have now stabilised and it is a bit more clear who is on whose side, but many challenges still remain.\n\nOur military is composed of veterans and volunteers, with no clear picture of the chain of command. We are struggling with supplying our troops and establishing direct supply routes. We also don't have a clear picture of battles that have been fought and what tactics our enemy is using. What should we do first?"

We have a rough idea of who and where our military is, and we have managed to secure some supply lines. However, the military still lacks overall cohesion and many units and militias operate independently from central command.\n\nOur military has a chain of command, but responsibilites and authorities are not always respected. We have a somewhat steady supply of weapons but many units have their own proprietary supplies. We also don't have a common tactic defined for our troops. What should we do try to improve?"

 civil_war_debuff.3.d: "The confusion in our military is starting to disappear. The way our soldiers act is starting to resemble an actual military now. Some minor problems still remain.\n\nThere exists some duplicate commands where commanders' authorities overlap. Military procurement orders sometimes disappear, and the money intended for them ends up outside of the troops. We are losing a lot of field experience and trainers as soldiers are discharged without documentation and casualties are not properly racked. What should we try to improve?"

 civil_war_debuff.3.b: "Fight corruption for military purchasing."
 civil_war_debuff.3.c: "Setup a process for passing down field experience."
 civil_war_debuff.4.t: "Our Military Recovers!"
 civil_war_debuff.4.d: "We are almost there. While some minor issues remain, our military is almost looking like it did before the war. Just a few more organisational reforms should turn our army fully professional again.\n\nThere are still several militias that aren't fully integrated into the army. Some of the equipment we are buying and producing isn't interchangeable. Our high command is requesting additional resources for analysing the combat experiences from the war. What should we try to improve?"
 civil_war_debuff.4.a: "Integrate the remaining militias."

The most controversial scene is that they visited the well-known War Shrine which enshrined and worships class-A war criminals, and said that the old-time relation between the state and the Emperor was very nice. In the last of the show, trippers have being cried because of being taught a story of loyal Kamikaze pilots.\n\nAlmost all of Leftists have started massive attacks and demand of apology, and they shouted that this patriotic and jingoistic program is completely violated against the Broadcasting Act which is regulating the political neutrality of all TV shows. However, Rightists are applauding that the show has done nothing wrong, then objected to Leftists that they are attacking the freedom of expression."

The most controversial scene is that some witnesses remarked that many Imperial Japanese Army's soldiers had kidnapped women and children to rape them and killed, after the fall of an Asian city by Japanese attack. In the last of the show, the historian alarmed that most of the teenagers who lives today in Japan are planning the violent attack against left-leaning Japanese newspapers and a group of Asians, because they have propagated the total fake stories of Japan's war crimes.\n\nAlmost all of Rightists have started massive attacks and demand of apology, and they shouted that this anti-patriotic and hostile program is completely violated against the Broadcasting Act which is regulating the political neutrality of all TV shows.

In conclusion, Leftists are blaming him and his former belonged party. On the other hand, some Rightists defend him; he has already recognised the geopolitical reality and just spoke out direct anxiety on Japan's military power and lack of diplomatic initiative."

In conclusion, Rightists are marching in the street with loud yelling of racism or anti-left slogans, and attacking not only the newspaper and the shopkeeper but also Chinese, Korean, Zainichis, and other Asian people. On the other hand, the Leftists and anti-fascist groups gathered and are shouting against them; obviously their just now doing the praise of the flag as the symbol of racist solidarity, so needless to say it should be banned."

Midst of this situation, one of the government-skeptical controversialists accused the government in a morning news show that these disgraces are caused not only for the [JAP.GetLeader]'s governance but also the corrupted morality in some ministries.

The dispute was once continued after the nationalisation, but now the oil field will define the legitimacy of Japan's rights of administration, with its building and labourers - of course, it does not mean they are human shields but."

With the educational reforms continued from last year, many kinds of government's research and summaries show that the children are successfully growing to be the nation of mentally sound and devoted. Based on that, some historic critics and parent groups like the Mother's League are demanding additional education programs to grow those students stronger and preserve them as the next generation's warriors of Japan. Although there are several objections like the style of Jukendo was for the twenty century's fighting and was already old-fashioned, a master priest of one large shrine contradicts that the key of the Jukendo is not the practicality of it but the preparation to arm the guns then the education of defending someone sincerely."

The people have undoubtedly decided to keep the article and maintain Japanese pacifism after the long debate for generations, but the [Root.GetLeader] regime does not respond to what the masses demand but is still trying to strengthen the conventional defensive expansionism. Rightists are relieved for this unchanged policy, despite leftists are in a huff. No one cannot make sure how long these atmospheres of giving-up and silent rage will continue."

 mdmosjap_japan.1512101.d: "The [Root.GetLeader] regime has taken over the legacy of contradiction between Article 9 and defence policies as the series of the interpretative constitutional amendment. Japan has launched a new \"Asia Pacific Defensive Association\" initiative along with the restart of PKO dispatch. People are now embracing and training how to survive through the new program of \"National Survival Drills\", beside the leftist's repulsion. However, the national discontentment on the \"neglected referendum\" is still setting their hearts on fire of anxiety for the future. Despite all of them, the Article 9 has still remained without any alteration. As the end of the long interpretative amendment, the regime is now asked the answer of how will Article 9 aim as an article of Japan's iconic pacifism."

They are, of course, welcomed this Initiative as peace-bringing policy and top-notch political decision in the Japan's history. Their civilian supporters have also started the vocal counterattack against rightists with the mimicking of the Boshin War - in short, the leftists themselves are the justice forces and the rightists are the rebels.

They are now doxxing, visiting, scribbling, vandalising and swatting these civilians' houses or workplaces as a matter of course.

At this moment, riot squads shot the non-lethal gas shell to halt these fighting, but falsely one police officier has shot live bullets to the protesters. The outcry of the protest was turned into the scream, and then these day's demonstration was stopped. The Metropolitan Police published that the shot was mistaken and illegal thing so the shooter will be punished soonly. But beside the announcement, the police warned the demonstrators that the police might be use more aggressive solutions to tranquilise the riot when protester have used some kind of violent measures. Following the announcement, almost all of demonstration groups has released counterargues: \"It was true that some radical group has taken an aggressive measures but it does not mean to allow the police to use the lethal weapon. And, It is reasonable that all of demonstrators was criticised by some groups' radical measures, but needless to say all of demonstrators are not radical, and then it does not mean to allow the police's suppression. Yesterday's tragedy revealed that the police has forgotten everything or not learnt anything about the killing of Michiko Kanba in 1960, and it was proved by the press conference, as the lack of respect or apologise for the killed protester.\""

In this session, there was no arguement about the democratic legitimacy or reasonability about the amendment, but some proposals of the one-year cooling-off period and the avoidance of authoritalian nature in the proceeding of constitutional amendment. Dietpersons explained that demonstrators's radicalising were caused by the deep concerning that the constitution might be changed into the past imperial-era-like authoritarian and undemocratic things and the government's insufficient explanation. Modest revisionists of [JAP.GetRulingParty] and its coalitions nod to these opinion, but some strong revisionists are not and demand to advance the process of amendment."

In metropolitan region, it is a daily scenery to see the skirmish between protesters and the riot police - the protester have thrown fire bottles, someones' cars have been burnt, the police shots the tear gas, and foreign journalists are filming it. The size of situation is still smaller than the average radicalised demonstration across the world, but Japan's street is turning into the demonstratior and police's battlefield like 1960's and 70's. Moreover, some pro-amendment  groups have been injuring the anti-amendment protesters by using some weapons.

Most of anti-amendment people have also replied almost same answers. Some commentators said on TV news-shows that these are obviously the result of Japan's past policy on the education like the praise of conservative life mind, the cruel self-responsibility theory and the return to \"traiditional\" moralism.

Due to the U.S.-Japan Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), Japan allows the staying of United State's military forces across Japanese lands, but about seventy percent of its U.S. Forces Japan (U.S.F.J.) territories occupy in the Okinawa Prefecture, which is fifteen percent of the Okinawa Mainland as well as eight percent of prefectural territories. Today's semi-occupation in Okinawa had been determined along with the administrative repatriation of the Okinawa Prefecture from the United State's occupied territories (the Ryukyu Government) in 1972, but many Okinawan citizens are still demanding to return the entire lands to themselves.\n\n[From.GetLeader] said that the Japanese government is going to effort decisively to take back the land that has still not been repatriated and has started planning various ways to grant Okinawan people's wishes whether it will be diplomatic or militaristic. Not only the Mainlander beyond political wings but also the Okinawans have mostly welcomed this remark.

It has already been two years since the first agreement, but Dietmembers are proposing to offer subsidies to those proprietors and labourers. The issue is not offering subsidies but the scale of subsidies, so the Diet is still arguing that the government should help some businesses that were really within the economic sphere of the base, although some members are demanding to help all proprietors and labourers."

Now the government has very vast lands in Okinawa, and the most were too good to obtain by the government, so the government is considering the redistribution of these lands. Land developers wish to gain those lands for redevelopment as the industrial zone, the tourist resort, or the tropic fruits field. However, some conservative Dietmembers are advocating that the U.S.F.J were there because there were conflicts in Asia, and the conflicts have not end yet, so we shall reuse those sites as our national defence forces' airbase, naval base, or land base."

For example, Futenma Air Base was built by destroying three villages, Ginowan (Jinon), Kamiyama, and Aragusuku, that was along with the large Luchu pines road, surrounded by agricultural fields, and had stores, an elementary school, post offices, and town halls. Therefore, needless to say, there are offspring of those residents. They should have to inherit the ownership of the land, and they should have to live there without moving anywhere if they wish. But it was ignored for decades, and it is still being ignored. The posterities have been dispersed, and live in Okinawa, or live in the Mainland. There are \"the Southern Territories\" problems in Japan, like \"the Northern Territories\". Today, the Dietmember asked the cabinet about the future treatment of these lands. Some are proposing that the whole land must be returned to the rightful offspring. Some are counterarguing that some land can be taken by the [Root.GetNameDef] by relocating the ownership in case of the refusal of owning it by the offspring - of course, the advocatives are saying it because they have already aimed to force to relocate ownerships."

Both of those cases are not allowed by the headquarters and Japanese subsidiaries of these enterprises have apologised. An entrepreneur of the company performing a business in [CHI.GetName] resents: \"this is not the demonstration, this is the government-driven terrorism.\" Needless to say almost all of the rightists, but many of the leftists are also appealing to the people that the \"China Risk\", the predicted menace on investing and expanding the business into China, has become real."

The People's Republic of China was built after the triumph of the second phase of the Chinese Civil War which was followed by Japan's surrender to the Allied Nations. Due to the above history, conservatives and right-wings demand the government with the pressure to apologise to [TAI.GetNameDef].

About a half-century they had maintained their country without any participation in any war even in the Cold War era, despite some critics gainsay there were several virtual participation under the banner of peacekeeping. However, modern Japanese seems to have decided that they do not want to contain themselves under pacifism at last. Today, the Diet has passed the bill for the war declaration.

First, Kanemaru got a 500 million yens of contribution from the delivery company Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin but he did not report this. The company, which was already amalgamated into the parent company for the case describes below, was run by Hiroyasu Watanabe, who had a connection with a Yakuza group Inagawakai and gained a strong connection with Kanemaru for the past intermediation to stop the \"backhanded compliment\" attack by the right-wing group Nihon Kominto against Kanemaru's confidant Noboru Takeshita, who had run for the LDP presidential election campaign. Second, Kanemaru had succeeded a bank debenture bond as an asset from his ceased wife, but he did not report this to the tax authorities. The investigation against him and his secretary revealed more than a billion yen not paid yet and another 10 million yens of gold bars hidden in his safe. In the end, Kanemaru was arrested for the latter case but the people were already disappointed for not being arrested in the former case.\nHis scandal caused a nationwide distrust against the politics, then the LDP was lost in the 1993 Lower House General Election. The LDP's long hegemony since 1955 ended once. After taking back the ruler's seat by the accusation for the non-LDP Hosokawa administration with the pretext of his involvement in the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal, the LDP attacked the Komei-to, the party backed by the Nichiren-school-Buddhism-based excommunicated religion group Soka Gakkai, to grope with a coalition with the Japan Socialist Party (JSP), and the other anti-LDP conservatives and anti-communists formed a new party, Shinshin-to (New Frontier Party). The Shinshin-to, led by Ichiro Ozawa who was a former Keiseikai faction LDP member, built the largest opposition party, but they also were backed by Soka Gakkai too. For this reason and the pledge discordance on the taxation policy, the vote was split and the Shinshin-to had failed to get the ruling seat in the 1996 Lower House General Election.\nWhile the Shinshin-to was going to collapse and the Komei-to was going to an independent path, the JSP has also collapsed. The JSP's coalition with conservative LDP let their supporters' eyes to see it as the \"conversion of ideology\", which caused the split of the party between left and right of socialism. The coalition was collapsed, then the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) were born. The sole fortunate overthrower LDP had changed their mind for stabilising their reign, then approached the Komei-to, and the Jiyu-to (Liberal Party, LP), one of the results of the Shinshin-to's collapse and led by Ozawa. They agreed on a coalition with LDP.\nIn the election of 1999, the LDP-Komei-LP \"Ji-Ji-Ko\" coalition won the election and retook the ruler's seat with the confidence of the election."

The group was born as a branch of \"the Communist's League - Red Army Faction\" which initiated the 1970's Anpo Protests.

On May 30th of 1972, colluding with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Shigenobu and her Japan Red Army caused a mass shooting massacre terror at the Lod Airport (Ben Gurion International Airport) in Tel Aviv, Israel. In the 1977 Japan Air Lines Flight 472 Incident (Dhaka Hijacking Incident), the Japan Red Army forced the then Japan's Takeo Fukuda government to release the other arrested other Red Army member. Fukuda released the arrested member with his famous remark, \"the one life of one person is heavier than the Earth\", which terrorism led to the establishment of the Japanese police special squad - \"SAT\".\n\nShigenobu was being searched under the international fugitive warrant for the 1974 French Embassy attack in The Hague (The Hague Incident).

He once proposed various policies for fighting against wasteful public investments and corruption, such as expanding social welfare, prohibiting the door-revolving on personnel affairs, and stopping dam constructions nationwide. He also aimed at establishing the two-party system in Japan as becoming the ruling party. However, in the fall of this year, his reassignment of the DPJ executives caused an internal conflict among some party members. And his arbitrary plan to amalgamate the party with the Ozawa's LP decayed the support for him rapidly. Due to taking responsibility for the chain of above confusion, he announced his resignation."

 mdmosjap_japan.170425001.d: "9:18 AM, April 25, 2005 - An Fukuchiyama Line (JR Takaradzuka Line) intercity rapid-service train, operated by JR West, has been derailed at the curve and collided with the 1st parking floor of an Apartment in Amagasaki City, Hyogo. In the first report, many people believed that 6 cars of a multiple-unit train derailed, but the rescue team revealed that the train had 7 cars but the controlling car which had been placed at the forward had been completely buried in the apartment. According to the investigation, the train had entered the sharp right curve at 72 mph even though the curve has limited the running speed to the section up to 43 mph. It shows that the centrifugal force made the train derail and crash into the apartment.\nAccording to the interrogation from the conductor who was on the last car, he and the killed motorman had attempted to recover the 90 seconds delay because the company is inflicting harsh punishments on every motorman and the conductor who had failed in the train operation. For example, being forced to hand-copy the whole working rules of the company, being forced to stand on an asphalt-paved platform on the summer sunny day, being forced to be bombarded by other operators with abusive languages - that is what the company imposed to train operators who caused the mere tens seconds of delay or the over-run mere one meter. That punishment, the \"daily service-serving education (Nikkin Kyoiku)\", has used to be introduced to suppress the power of labourer unions when the Japan National Railway (JNR) was being privatised and being transformed into the six Japan Railway (JR) companies in the Nakasone administration.\nFortunately, another limited express train, which was coming from the opposite track that had been blocked by derailed cars, has urgently stopped before it had hit. However, it was morning commuter time and many passengers were taken, so 107 were killed and 562 were injured by the accident. This is the worst tragedy in Japanese railroad history. Some medical specialists pointed out that many passengers did not die shortly after the collision but had from the crush syndrome."
 mdmosjap_japan.740510001.t: "An Ex-Imperial Japanese Army Veteran Passed Away"
 mdmosjap_japan.740510001.d: "On June 16th of 2005, an ex-Imperial Japanese Army soldier passed away.\n\nKenzo Okuzaki, born in 1920, was in service on the Papua New Guinea front after being transferred from China and was a man who was disloyal to his officer. On the first day of his troop's landing in New Guinea, the USAF bombed them and he started the escape from New Guinea. Surviving from the fear of starvation and glimpsing other Japanese soldiers' bodies rotten or bulged by the gas, he lost his right little finger to the native's attack, then finally surrendered to the American troops. Okuzaki was treated by an American doctor, not like being killed as he once believed, and then detained in Australia until the war ended.\n\nAs he stabbed a captain of demobilisation ship for the captain's misappropriation of food for the demobilised, and accidentally murdered an estate agent by the trouble in the leasing agreement, his disloyalty and anti-authority were totally transformed into the vengeance against injustices - especially Emperor Hirohito as the ultimate symbol of injustice. But he changed his mind in the end: the assassination of Hirohito is not only worthless for solving the social structure of post-war Japan which still kept the Emperor system, but also may just rebuild another different type of Emperor-like system by the society instead of discontinuing the Emperor system. Then he changed his plan to shoot Hirohito, not with a gun but with a slingshot, to gather the mass media's attention.\n\nAfter being released from the ten-year prison term, on January 2nd of 1969, Okuzaki attended the new-year ceremony in the Imperial Palace that was paused for six years for the construction of the new Chowa-den building, then screamed \"Yamazaki, shoot the Emperor with your pistol!\" - \"Yamazaki\" was the name of his colleague soldier who possibly died in New Guinea. Okuzaki gathered other participants' eyes then shot four slingshots toward Hirohito. His shot did not hit Hirohito eventually, but during the 22 months of custody without the judgement, Okuzaki wrote his thoughts aforementioned into 36 notebooks and 193 pages of written statements. In the statement, he blamed mankind for the forming of the Emperor system or the Emperor-like system in their own structure of human society and condemned Buddha, Jesus, Confucius, Carl Marx, and Mao Zedong as useless. He published that statement as a book: \"Yamazaki, Shoot the Emperor!\".\n\nAfter being released again, Okuzaki has arrested again for distributing pornographies that photofablicated with faces of the Imperial Family, ran as a candidate for the Upper House in the jail, then being released again and he published a book titled with the death threat against Former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. While recording the WWII documentary film \"The Emperor's Naked Army Marches On\" (1987), in which Okuzaki played himself, he was arrested for the attempted murder of a son of an ex-company commander whom Okuzaki targeted, and released in 1997. While there are considerable dangerous criminal records, surprisingly Okuzaki is neither famous nor infamous for his acts. However, his reputation by someone who knows about him is various: a tragic veteran, a victim of the age, a paranoid psycho, a vicious criminal, an anti-Imperial-system anarchist, a fighter against the authorities, a man who has been forced to be forgotten by the post-war-style unwritten lese-majesty, or just an actor, or just a writer."

A Japanese man throwing a raw egg at a runner...\n\nAfter the chaos, a Tibetan refugee and five Japanese have arrested.

There once was approved silently for the good neighbourhood friendship by installing fences and holding parties of cultural exchange burdened by the school, but the situation was turned over by the removal of fences for expanding the Hanshin Expressway in 2009.\nThe school had placed many school equipment like goalposts and a platform for the morning assembly at the park, and the neighbour children were hard to play at the park for the school club activities. At long last, a salaryman has contacted Zaitokukai to make them perform a protest against the Korean school. In the end, Zaitokukai has called other extreme right-wing nationalist groups, \"Zaitokukai (Association of Citizens against the Special Privileges of the Zainichi)\", \"Shukenkai (Association for restoring the sovereignty)\" and \"Team Kansai\", to hold a loud protest.\nHowever, the protest was not only blaming the illegal occupation but also chanting antiforeignism with plenty of racist remarks. \"This playground was stolen by your father, in the chaos of war, by raping and killing someone's wives\", \"Get lost from Japan. F--- the children, you are the children of spies\", \"The promise is a thing mankind can do. And Koreans can't make any promises to mankind.\" - It was Friday so there were 170 children in the park, but the protesters continued these offensive speeches then broke the platform and goalposts. Teachers have evacuated the children from the park into the school and closed the gate; nevertheless, the protest was continued.\nIn conclusion, parents and graduates of the Korean school and the Kyoto Prefectural Police have arrived there, and the protest became a physical conflict.

And now, she is strongly wishing to visit Japan to meet with the parents of Taguchi. It may become a huge milestone for accusing North Korea's abductions, but Japan's Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act is preventing the entry of foreigners who once was sentenced to the death penalty, so she cannot visit even it was nullified by the South Korean government.

He was born in 1899 and the municipality where he had lived believed he was alive until the day, but the autopsy has confirmed that he had been already dead in 1978, the 32 years ago. The local police have arrested his bereaved family for the fraud of pension receiving. As the news spreads, all municipalities had started confirming the pensioner's existence, and as a result, it has revealed that many old ages who were being believed living more than a hundred years have died at least six years ago. In the investigation, some pensioners recorded as over 150 years old, which means they are born in 1860 if they were alive. In Iki City, Nagasaki Prefecture, an old man already confirmed to be dead quite a long time ago has recorded 200 years old and living. If he were still alive, he would be listed on the Guinness World Records as a world longest alive person from 1810, the same year Frederic Chopin was born. These sensational cases are concluded as the lack of investigation by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the municipalities, and the authorities of pension. The minister of MHLW have apologised for these stories and stated that the every pensioners who are not identified by the municipalities will be omitted from the pension program. Although the police and the prosecutors have arrested many bereaved families for these cases and are going to file charge them for the fraud as well as the abandoning of the dead body, the authorities also told that they cannot make them to return the pensions already taken more than five years ago for the statute of limitations in the fraud crime."

The strong quake and huge tsunami have also hit the TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant which is located at Okuma Town in Fukushima Prefecture. The main cooling structures of the power plant were shut down by the earthquake safety system, but the alternative cooling system did not start due to the sunken of the emergency electricity system by the tsunami, and it caused the failure of cooling the reactors. The entire staff of the power plant had tried all possible measures to prevent the overheating of reactors, but at 15:36 PM on March 12th, Reactor 1 caused a hydrogen explosion by the core meltdown. This moment of the protecting building being blasted was broadcasted across the world. Two days later, Reactor No.3 had also exploded, and Reactor No.2 and No.4 had done too in the next day.\n\nAt the same time as the explosion, a massive amount of radioactive substances have been released into the water and the air. In Shinjuku, the average radiological dosage was increased from 0.15 micro-SV per hour to 0.8. The fallout is seemingly polluting the large area of Northern Kanto, and the radioactively contaminated water is also leaking into the Pacific Sea."

In 2012, a neo-conservative party \"The Spirit of Japan Party (Nippon Soshin-to)\" and another traditional-conservative party \"Sunrise Party (Tachiagare Nippon - Taiyo no To)\", was led by Shintaro Ishihara, was amalgamated into the Japan Restoration Party, a brother party of the Osaka Restoration Association. However, the amalgamation made the Japan Restoration Party splitting between the Tooru Hashimoto's faction and the Shintaro Ishihara's faction. Meanwhile, \"Your Party (Minna no To)\", the party once called a new hope for the third pole, was split in 2013 and give the birth of 2014's \"Unity Party (Yui no To)\" which was led by Kenji Eda. The Hashimoto faction decided the second amalgamation with Eda's party, which led to the birth of the \"first\" Japan Innovation Party. After one year's partisan conflicts such as the second split between the Minshin-to faction and the Innovation faction, and the duplicative renaming of his party to \"Initiatives from Osaka (Osaka Ishin no Kai, describe Osaka as Hiragana)\", Hashimoto resigned from the party leader. And with their success of offensive-infiltrative electoral strategies in the Kinki region, the newly elected leader Ichiro Matsui renamed the party from \"Initiatives from Osaka\" to \"Japan Innovation Party (Nippon Ishin no Kai)\" again. They are advocating the center-right renovations and the regional decentralisation of the power. However, some leftists are seeing them as the group of neo-liberal neo-conservatives, and also most rightists are seeing them as a duplication of conventional conservatives."

Ishiba was one of candidated persons in the past LDP Presidential Election and lost to [Root.GetLeader], but after that he established a slightly but large partisan \"Suigetsukai\" into  the LDP, and continued many opposite stance and speech with keeping friendly. Ishiba denied his involving but pro-regime Sankei Newspaper has published as true, and [Root.GetLeader] has distributed a copy of this article to all LDP Dietpersons. Ishiba and a member of Suigetsukai has protested this move. After that, he told in the TV that that regulation is not \"Ishiba Regulation\" but \"Abe Regulation\" because it was a cabinet decision. A leader of the Opposition has supported Ishiba for their suspicious view of scandals. By these struggle, some national people is starting to see that the LDP and [Root.GetLeader]'s Regime is about to unstable. As stand and see at the LDP's view, the only good news is that some leftist parties is slightly getting lost their popularity because the people is also seeing this as a interesting power game and some leftists are now supporting Ishiba's LDP partisan for their anti-Abe stance."

 mdmosjap_japan.290725101.d: "Newspaper, Radio, Television - these old medium have once led the national consciousness, in the culture, and in the politics. The media has used to make promote the war, and also to make the introspect the war. After the war, the media has begun to promote the new western culture instead of old patriotic ones, and that is the source of some activists accuses the media is flippant, but there is a unaltered fact - no matter how everybody said it is an old media, but it still has a powerful influence. Internet, the great invention of the end of 20th Century, has brought the great shift of what does the Media stand for. Everybody can send information is now meaning everybody could become the media itself. Especially the invention of the BBS, SNS, OVP, and Streaming Service brought everyone the oppotunity to say and hear directly what are they thinking - and that means people can send and receive the radical and dangerous opinion, and freely.\n\nBy recent events about Moritomo and Kake, Newspapers in Japan are completely divided: the critical Asahi Newspaper and the pro-governmental Sankei Newspaper. Following the lost of war, Asahi had revoked old patriotic style and transformed into the left-lean journalism. On the other hand the Sankei has grown as a vanguard of right-lean journalism in the LDP's 1955 System. Japanese Internet geeks mostly like the Sankei for its \"Honne\" and condemn the Asahi for its past leftist journalism and fabrications. First it was a fashion only in the Internet world but the popularising of mobile phone and releasing of broadband made it a national consciousness, and seemingly today's national people are being divided and be radicalised to the left and right."

 mdmosjap_japan.330213001.d: "11:8 PM, February 13th, 2021 - a robust M7.3 earthquake struck off Fukushima Prefecture. The JMA calculated its scale as 6+ and judges as an aftershock of the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, a catastrophic earthquake attacked a decade before. No lethal tsunamis were hit but landslides, and according to the correspondent, several old wooden houses and old medium-rise buildings were tumbled down or destroyed with dangerous x-shaped cracks in Fukushima Prefecture. Many of thermal power plant was downed at once so massive blackouts hit except central of Tokyo. While the earthquake pulled down electric wire poles for the Tohoku Shinkansen, the Joban line, a regular railroad once destroyed by the earthquake, tsunami, and leaked radiation a decade before, and reconstructed in this decade, became an emergency diversion line of the Shinkansen. Aside from the direct damages, the earthquake made a lot of discriminatory information than before. Most of that disinformation was based on the \"someone will attack Japan by force soon\" anxiety agitation and the actual \"Koreans poisoned wells\" demagoguery which once had led to genocide against Koreans in the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake. An SNS user who named himself \"Emperor\" brought a poor-taste rumour, \"The President of the United States who had left without paying for his beef rice bowl poisoned wells\" as \"a joke for anyone who believes false information\", but it called a strong backlash as one of the shape-changed racism. After all, The earthquake killed a people, injured more than 100 people, caused fires and rockfalls, and brought many misinformation into the Internet."

The JMA calculated its scale as 5+ and alerted the tsunami caution, the lowest alert scale in JMA tsunami alerts, to the coast of the prefecture. However, this day was just a decade and nine days later of the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami, so the local people have remembered the flashback of the catastrophe then were evacuated from the coast to safe hill straightaway. At the same time, every local news program showed the alert with only a word, \"RUN\". After all, any observation points were not hit a remarkable change in tidal level. Eleven were injured slightly by the earthquake but no one was killed. In Shiogama City where had been estimated the JMA scale as 4, a residential area was suffered by the landslide."

After two hours later, at 10:28 AM, a local resident called the fire department that the landslide was destroying a house. And as rescue teams arrived, a catastrophic volume of mud landslide flushed through the valley then tens of houses and cars were destroyed and buried. The landslides had attacked the valley again and again, the mud went down through the underpass of Tokaido Shinkansen and Tokaido Main Line, reached the coast side of the town. The scene was recorded by many residents and has been uploaded to the Internet. The landslide destroys 131 houses, killed 19 people, injured 3, and 8 residents are still missing.\nAs the news spreads on the Internet, SNS users used to be glaring their suspicious eyes toward the \"Mega Solar\", the solar power station installed on the higher ridge of Izusan, as the decisive \"suspect\" of the landslide. On the other hand, according to the disaster report by the Shizuoka Prefecture, the landslide had come from the other side of the solar power station.

 mdmosjap_japan.340201001.t: "Shintaro Ishihara Passed Away"
 mdmosjap_japan.340201001.d: "Today, the famous writer and the retired politician Shintaro Ishihara has passed away.\n\nShintaro Ishihara came out with his first book, \"Gray Classroom\". He won the Bungei Shunju's Newcomer Award for his second novel, \"Season of the Sun (Season of Violence, 1955)\". Like \"Crazed Fruit\" and \"Execution Room\" (both 1956), his novels have been filled with the summer energy of youth and sexual immorality so sometimes he got an opinion by critics as an anti-social before. As his novel cinematised with his young brother and actor Yujiro Ishihara, his books created the new generation, \"Taiyo-zoku\", which had military hair (called Sports Cuts), wore sunglasses and Hawaiian shirts, and indulged in the sex with someone. This Taiyo-zoku movement finally caused the age restriction and the rating organisation for the movie.\n\nHe also wrote a lot of essays as a social critic, and got a lot of applause and criticism in his life. \"Spartan Education\" (1969) created the national generation movement of parental education: to be harsh and to be violent against their children like once Greek Spartans did. \"The Japan That Cannot Say No (The Japan That Can Say No: Why Japan Will Be First Among Equals, 1989)\", co-written with Akio Morita, the Chairman of Sony, praised the Japanese ability for technologies, criticised business cultures in the United States, and also criticised Japanese weakness on business and self-assertion.\n\nWhile having made in debut on the political stage as a Dietmember, he got strong criticism for his theory of education, nationalistic ideology, and a lot of gaffes, sometimes with racism and ableism. He visited the Yasukuni Shrine every year, he always called China as \"Shina\", and he denied the crime of forced labour against the comforted women by the Imperial Japanese Army during WWII. In his term as the Chief of the Environment Agency, although he apologised to the sufferers of Minamata disease as the government, he called some Minamata survivors, \"they have low IQ\" and \"they do nothing but just want subsidies\" in 1976. In the 3.11 disaster, he left a gaffe: \"We need to wash the (Japanese) greediness by this tsunami at this time. So this is Heaven's judgement\". Meanwhile, during his term as Tokyo Metropolitan Governor, he enacted the emission control in advance of the world's movement, and he continued to apologise to the Korean victims of racist demagogues in the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake.\n\nAlbeit his ideology and principles, he is still getting a firm reputation by leftist critics too as well as the rightists. However, the public reputation for him is now purely divided - in a sense, he had freedom in his thinking; in a sense, he did not have prudence in his saying."

Abe was immediately transported to the hospital but died at 5:3 PM.\n\nThe moment of the assassination was being recorded by the public that was to listen to Abe's speech. The attacker, ex-JMSDF personnel, testified that he made guns by himself instead of hand-made bombs and shot two. According to the foreign media, the suspect referred to the Unification Church (The Family Federation for World Peace and Unification), a religious organisation, and he primarily attempted to attack the executive of this group for his grudge and the relationship with Abe, because his mother was a fanatic member of \"the cult\" and it led to the bankruptcy of his family.\n\nAll politicians and LDP members mourned his death, and every party across the ruling and the opposition accused the attacker of the violence against democracy and showed solidarity. The Japanese people are shocked by the gun violence and the attack on politics and democracy. The media is comparing the incident to the past attempted assassination against Shin Kanemaru or the actual assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, and the SNS is afraid that the assassination would repeat the past police-state pre-war dark time like after the assassination of the May 15th incident and the February 26th incident occurred."

Nobusuke Kishi was the grandfather of Shinzo Abe, and Abe also kept ties with the Unification Church. And as a truth (but became an open secret, or taboo, or some kind of alternative conspiracy theory), Abe sent a message video to the forum held by a satellite group of the Unification Church in 2020. Meanwhile, the Unification Church's founder Sun Myung Moon was preaching some tenets which were not only anti-communism, but also anti-Japanese, such as Japan is Satan's nation, and \"Eva Japan\" must donate \"Adam Korea\" to support financially.\nThe anti-constitutional-amendist are pointing out that the LDP's policies and the LDP-drafted constitution are entirely similar to the tenet of Unification Chuch, such as the heavy focus on the value of family, and negation of the LGBT+ community.\nAnd the lawyers' group which is against the \"inspiration business\" (Reikan-syoho) groups points out that the deep relationship between religion and the past governments eventually allowed cults to keep their immoral businesses which is still leading to the bankruptcy of their members.\n\nNeedless to say, most people share the infuriation not only on the assassination.\nBut they also get angry against the TV media for hiding or avoiding to refer to the name of the Unification Church, like a Streisand effect.\n\nAnd social media is... becoming a complete cesspit of turmoil.\nRightists are divided: accusing the relationship with the Unification Church, or accusing Koreans because they gave the Unification Church, or defending the Unification Church because Abe is absolute, or also defending the Unification Church because they are better than liberal or leftists.\nLeftists are also divided: accusing the Unification Church and destroy them like the AUM Shinrikyo, or charging the Unification Church but defending the freedom of faith, or just accusing Abe and LDP as literally the cult of personality.\nAnd there are other people: who avoiding to listen to that shady relationship, who preaching their old tale in their university fight between the Unification Church's \"Genriken\" and Chukaku-ha, accusing not only LDP or the Unification Church but also other parties of their own relationship like the Rissho Kosei-kai or the Jissen Rinri Koseikai, and who just sneering rightists or leftists in their surmising that they just hate Abe or liberals on each other."

This legislation aims to control the commercial distribution, liberalise book pricing, and regulate unique governmental licenses on the book reselling, with several criminal penalties for its violation. The legislation consists of the amendment of other acts, such as the Antimonopoly Law, as well as the new \"Secondhand Books Resellers Control Act\".\n\nThe Oppositions and activists for the freedom of thought are loudly criticising this legislation. First, liberalising of pricing will not be able to buy books at an appropriately affordable price anymore as well as will lead to sell at higher prices in remote rural areas. Second, it cannot allow reselling the book without the license then the reader would just dump books into the garbage so that the book from past to present will not have remained for the future generation. Third, those difficulties will lead the publishing to be more agitating, more profitable, more biased, less educational, less reliable, and less diversified.

 #Kato's Revolt
 #----------------------------------------------------------------
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.1.t: "The Quintet"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.1.d: "Yoshiro Mori has been elected as the Prime Minister in the Diet after being elected as the president of LDP in April, as \"the successor\" of former Prime Minister Obuchi. At the same time, some criticisms hit Mori for the process of how he was elected.\n\nTo begin with, Mori was not elected on the LDP's internal election but was appointed by five executives of the party in the end. After Obuchi went into the hospital, Mori and the other four \"colossi\" of the LDP had gathered at a hotel in Tokyo. After a while, Masakuni Murakami, an attendance, said \"Mr. Mori, there's no one but you\", then other attendees sided with that voice so Mori was appointed.\nSecond, the attendees at the hotel meeting have only consisted of the Mori faction, Obuchi faction, and Kamei faction and not included Kato faction, the rivalry group of Obuchi's. Koichi Kato, the leader of the Kato faction which belongs the Kochi-kai, is a rival of Keizo Obuchi since the 1998 LDP presidential election. Kato is the most proven one of leading the LDP to the strategic win on the 1996 Lower House Election against the Shinshin-to. However, Obuchi was disregarding Kato in the party for the difference of policies, while Kato is supported by the masses and the market. Because Obuchi was an advocate of fiscal spending, on the contrary Kato is a one of fiscal consolidation. And Kato is expected to be the next Prime Minister of Japan from the masses.\n\nConsidering these situations, the process done by the five members is evidently undemocratic one of the backroom politics like the old days in the Soviet Union."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.1.oA: "Backroom politics and partisan conflicts. That's what is the LDP."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.2.t: "Koichi Kato and Kochi-kai"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.2.d: "Koichi Kato is a Diet member of the LDP and the influential member of the Kochi-kai faction. He was elected in 1972 for the first time and given a seat of the cabinet in the Masayoshi Ohira and Kiichi Miyazawa administration. In 1994, he and Hiromu Nonaka and Taku Yamasaki promoted the Ji-Sha-Sa (LDP-JSP-Sakigake) Coalition and were against the dual-conservative coalition plan between the LDP and the right faction of Shinshin-to. He was appointed to the Secretary-General of the LDP and led his party into winning on the 1996 Lower House Election of the two-party match against the Shinshin-to, then took back an absolute majority by his \"luring strategy\". His strategy led to the collapse of Shinshin-to, but the LDP lost in the 1998 Upper House Elections, then Kato resigns as the Secretary-General. He succeeded the chairperson of the Kochi-kai faction from Miyazawa and challenged for the 1999 LDP Presidential Election. Kato had a showdown with Yamasaki and Obuchi, despite he was supporting Obuchi because Kato felt the internal election like the Presidential Election was just a gateway to success, but Obuchi did not. Obuchi, the chairperson of the Heisei Kenkyukai (Heiseiken, former Keiseikai) faction, showed a fit of anger that his running was interrupted by Kato and Yamasaki. After Obuchi was elected, he tried to exclude Kato and Yamasaki from any status. While Kato and his Kochi-kai were getting an over-exclusion in the LDP, Kato's reformistic perspective for fiscal soundness and market liberalism gave him the national expectancy. And his Kochi-kai is one of the mainstream of LDP conservatism, despite Obuchi's oppression and Kato's liberal perspective. In addition, he has a strong anti-Keiseikai (anti-Heiseiken) \"YKK\" friendship, with Taku Yamasaki and Junichiro Koizumi. After the breaking down and death of Obuchi, and Mori's indistinct election and his gaffe, Kato is feeling the LDP will lose to the upcoming 2001 Upper House Elections."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.2.oA: "Can he be the Fuunji of this troubled time?"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.3.t: "Kato Uprises Against LDP"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.3.d: "The approval rate of Mori is touching the bottom. Not only for his \"divine nation\" gaffe in May but also his appointment as the Prime Minister is not welcomed by the people. In October, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hidenao Nakagawa was forced to quit his job for the dine meeting with right wings and his affair scandal. The situation has given the Oppositions the oppotunity to move the vote of nonconfidence against the Mori Cabinet.\n\nIn the atmosphere of nationwide disappointment against Mori and his LDP, Koichi Kato held a meeting at a Japanese Restaurant in Hotel Okura Tokyo with Nakasone-faction-leaning political commentators, and he said \"I will not let him reshuffle his Cabinet.\" His remark was sent in a minute by Keiichiro Nakamura, one of the attending political commentators and the Special Advisor of the Mori Cabinet. Needless to say, the LDP's Secretary-General Hiromu Nonaka blames Kato's \"revolt\" and warns that the member who sympathised with Kato will be expelled from the party."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.3.oA: "Warn the expulsion to him and his sympathisers."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.3.oB: "He's also a patriot, his administration might be better than Mori..."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.4.t: "Miyazawa's Decision"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.4.d: "There was no delay for the Kato's faction and Kochi-kai to be shaken its stability. The LDP executives are blaming the revolt and threatening the sympathiser with the risk of electoral endorsement for candidature as the party. Makoto Koga who was close to Kato is seemingly considering keeping the ties or cutting off and approach Nonaka. Junichiro Koizumi, one of the YKK friendships, is attending the TV news shows continuously and announcing loudly that Kato is going to second a motion.\n\nKiichi Miyazawa, the Ex-Prime Minister and the former leader of the Kochi-kai Faction, might be supposed to oppose the revolt. Kato wished that he will succeed Miyazawa's faction, but Miyazawa had considered that the successor of his faction was Yohei Kono, not Kato. However, Kono is now the leader of the Taiyu-kai faction (Kono Group) for opposing Kato, after he lost the faction career race in 1995, then, of course, he is now opposing the revolt. Meanwhile, some sources told that Miyazawa had unclearly but showed a supportive stance for Kato before the day of revolt. And Kato also referred that Kono might be the next Prime Minister"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.4.oA: "Miyazawa opposes the revolt."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.4.oB: "Miyazawa supports the revolt."
 #mdmosjap_japan_kato.5.t: "Hashimoto Faction and Junichiro Koizumi"
 #mdmosjap_japan_kato.5.d: "The Keiseikai (Hashimoto Faction), which was led by Ex-Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, has appeared to have some solid solidarity of iron. It has been proven by the wrath of Secretary-General Hiromu Nonaka, who is a member of the faction. However, a few young members are not showing a stance of cooperation for the faction. Because some executives of the factions have said something like \"we must stamp down the rebellion but it is by no means going to support the Mori Cabinet.\"\n\nThe above rumour of \"Mori Tsubushi\" (attempted crushing of Mori administration) reached Junichiro Koizumi's ears, one of the anti-Keiseikai groups and the member of Mori's faction. Koizumi has no strong supportive base for him but some LDP member is seeing that he may run for the next party presidential election with the anger against \"double-tongued and fragile\" Hashimoto Faction. Crush the revolt with Nonaka or tighten up the youth faction member - the Hashimoto faction is standing on the branching of the path."

 mdmosjap_japan_kato.6.t: "Do-Nichi Kosaku"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.6.d: "It is the weekend. From Saturday to Sunday, the Dietpersons go back to their home electoral districts to hear tons of appeals, demands, and scolding from their supporters.\n\nAhead of the weekend, Yukio Hatoyama, the leader of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), and Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the Liberal Party (LP), were reported to advise Kato that he must call for the vote of nonconfidence on Friday, November 17th. They must have had the same concern that the Dietpersons gone back to their constituency might be prevailed on to oppose the Kato's revolt. However, the proposal was finally rejected by Kato for his confidence in prevailing the faction member by himself.\nNeedless to say, LDP's Nonaka also has started to move toward the weekend and he is going to dictate the preparation for the general election to the party's prefectural branches. But, the most important thing is, he is showing his might of the right of endorsement for candidates, which means the party member being sympathised with Kato will definitely be expelled from the party. Moreover, Nonaka brandishes his plan that the party would field the rival candidate on the same constituency where the \"traitor\" held. Those strategies would work better to make the party member restraining under the control of the party.\n\nThe vote of censure for the Mori Cabinet is supposed to be moved on the 20th of Monday."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.6.oA: "Send the order with the warning of the possibility of rival candidates."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.6.oB: "Just order to prepare for the general election."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.7.t: "Failure of Kato's Revolt"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.7.d: "20th of November. The LDP executives efforted a lot of maneuvers harder for suppressing the Kato's revolt. The executives sent the notice of dismissal by the content-certified mail to Koichi Kato and Taku Yamasaki, one of the YKK friendships. After Kiichi Miyazawa determined his stance to oppose Kato, his close two advisors Yuya Niwa and Makoto Koga also made their minds to be estranged from him. The Kochi-kai has been divided.\n\nIn the night, Kato and Yamasaki held the last meeting at Hotel Okura Tokyo with the member of their factions before the voting of censure. At the moment that Kato and Yamasaki tried to leave the hotel in order to vote yes on the motion like two samurais are going to commit seppuku for their plotting of revolt, a faction member Sadakazu Tanigaki grabbed Kato's shoulder then shouted \"Kato Sensei is our captain! Don't charge without us! When you move we'll follow you too!\" Kato was impressed and dropped tears for the faction members' solidarity and their determination to be taken the joint responsibility. After the persuasion, Kato and Yamasaki finally determined to not attend the vote, to wait for the punishment. These dramatic scenes were going on the air across the nation in a few minutes later.\n\nThe vote of non-confidence was prolonged by the sudden disorder brought by Kenshiro Matsunami, a Conservative Party (CP/NCP) member, who had sprinkled the water from his glass toward a DPJ member Hisayasu Nagata as the counterattack of booing. AM 4:0, after Matsunami got forced out of the meeting, the censure against the Mori cabinet has been rejected."

As expected, he seems to consider that Kato and his followers are also the same colleague of the patriot with the same orientation of conservativism - or, perhaps he concerns a scenario that the banishing of Kato's faction would lead their amalgamation with the DPJ."

 mdmosjap_japan_kato.11.t: "Mori Cabinet is Removed!"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.11.d: "Unexpectedly, the motion of censure against the Mori cabinet has been passed. Mori's passive move on the last weekend, which was not to put up rival candidates onto constituencies where the Kato-sympathisers have, showed his cowardice to other LDP Diet members, especially the executives and youth members. Member after member, they were not the sympathiser, also changed their stance to oppose Mori. Kato and Yamasaki attended the plenary session with mathematical confidence to watch the success."

Then many newspapers and 'wide-show' tv programs named this drama 'the Mirage Dissolution' from the pun of an on'yomi reading of 'Mori Yoshiro'. As the Lower House dissolves, the new election tour has started. It is the first time since the current post-war constitution administers the country the people are seeing the Lower House Election twice in the same year."

 mdmosjap_japan_kato.13.d: "Mori already showed his retreat from the frontline against the rebellion. He knew that there were failures on the backroom politics in the hotel and the 'divine nation' gaffe he dropped by himself. Kato also got some confidence in his winning as Mori's stance went into the public, and the Diet's plenary session for the motion of censure against Mori's cabinet has launched on the 17th of November with the help of Ozawa. In the end, the censure naturally has been passed, then..."

Every medium is focusing to report the defeat of LDP, even the [Root.GetRulingParty]-leaning one, like the sudden death of a great popular musician. The media are post-predicting the result by their self subjective prospect: the Mori's gaffe, or some national avoidance responses on the Kato's rebellion, or disappointment on the delayed political reform, or something else. Anyway, the truth is that the LDP has lost and the new ruling party of [Root.GetRulingParty] is showing some irritation against the media's unfair reporting."

 mdmosjap_japan_kato.51.d: "After the government formed a coalition among the Liberal Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, and the Komei-to (Ji-Ji-Ko Coalition), the LDP and the LP are at loggerhead for the issue of the national long-term care insurance system. While the LDP led by Keizo Obuchi is proposing that the financial resource of the system must be maintained only by the care insurance payment from the nation, the LP led by Ichiro Ozawa demands that the system should be held not only by the current way but also by the consumption tax. In addition, Ozawa asserts that not only the care insurance system but also the entire welfare for the retired, such as the pension and eldercare, must be supported by the consumption tax. In 1994, the then JSP's Murayama administration decided to increase the consumption tax from 3% to 5%, then the LDP's Hashimoto administration succeeded this in 1997, but it was an additional blow for the Japanese economy as the tax income and GDP fell in the next three years - this experience ties LDP up of the fear of tax boost. However, Ozawa is disregarding their anxiety and threatening LDP to accept his demand, otherwise a break-up of the coalition with the opposing on the ongoing bill of 1999 fiscal year's second supplementary budget."

This will lead the aggressive conflict between the prefectural branches and the headquarters as well as another friction among factions, then the LDP will be weakened in the end. Some members are claiming that the negotiation must rather be ended by LDP's hand at first then exclude him and strengthen the coalition only with Komei-to than being broken up and destabilise the party for the Ozawa's dream of \"two-party system\"."

Those surely share that liberalism is the precious thought that the people have gotten in the end, but the standards to measure \"liberalism\" are completely different among them, like there are the left radicalism, the centre-left, and the left-wing. Even if any compromises solidified them, they are naturally broken away - perhaps that is the literal nature of liberalism. And of course, there are two liberals on the political stage right now: the liberal members of LDP which includes the Left Kochi-kai, and the left members of the Democratic Party of Japan. To overcome the crisis, [Root.GetLeader] must talk with one of them to nullify the vote of non-confidence.

[Root.GetLeader] followed and acted this while the conservative members of the LDP attended the meeting. Now he is just to talk about his cosmetic patriotism which was remembered before the meeting. But about a half of members are never filled with the superficial passion for patriotism because they believe that not waving the flag but realising the stout economic growth is the key to gain the popularity which can be exchanged for patriotism. Whereas the fanatic rightwingers would feel they were neglected in their ideology if [Root.GetLeader] took to speak about the economic growth."

The Sunday debate program held some mild arguments among each representative of the executives, the Nakagawa faction, and the oppositions.

Not only this program but also the morning wide-show program broadcasting the Nakagawa faction's agitation so the children watch it before they go to school then mimic that in the classroom to gather the other children's popularity. The parents are also arguing the LDP crisis with other parents in the housing complex, or in the smoking-room, or in the park, or in the supermarket.

Perhaps some oppositions will take advantage of the people's voice.\n\nIn the end, the LDP crisis is no longer the crisis that can be ended within the LDP itself."

Also, the people are looking coldly on the anti-vaccine believer. This is just one of the far radical cases of anti-vaccine movement, but there are other cases of spreading misinformation about the vaccination. The cause of the infodemic is, one is the \"far-centric neutrality\" which is misapplied from the broadcasting neutrality, and the other is the SNS culture of \"First buzzed, first served\". Many professionals of medicals, politics, sociology, and anti-cult activists who once fight against Aum Shinrikyo, are trying to get rid of every misinformation as fast as possible, but any fact-checks are not catching up with the next production of misinformation. Those professionals, fact-checkers, and people are demanding the government to take part in the counter-spread resistance of the anti-vaccine misinformation, such as the full utilisation of the public service announcement or order every TV station and SNS company to prevent spreading. However, several dietmembers and cabinet members are not welcoming it for some reasons like they are already an anti-vaccine believer, or not an anti-vaccine believer but the risk for the freedom of speech by the participation, or feeling of rejection toward the cost and indemnification."
 mdmosjap_japancv.200101.oA: "Refute to Anti-vaccine believers, but take care of their the rights of thoughts at first."
 mdmosjap_japancv.200101.oB: "They just have an anxiety on vaccines. Take care of their anxiety, don't pressure them."
 mdmosjap_japancv.200101.oC: "They have the rights of speech."
 mdmosjap_japancv.200101.oD: "They're right! And we know that all business matter."
 mdmosjap_japancv.200101.oE: "They are needless to say, but some statistics should be also pruned."
 mdmosjap_japancv.200101.oF: "We know that not only old media but also SNSs are making them. Shut it down for a while."
