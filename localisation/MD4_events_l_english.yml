Keep in mind that predicting the future is difficult and hard work so it may be that our experts are wrong. \nWe would, of course, never dream to give your excellency orders on what to do, but making some adjustments now will be less painful than a full blown crisis in the future."

 econvent.2.t:0 "Collapsing housing prices"
 econvent.2.d:0 "As the prices of houses and appartments have went through the roof, especially in the last year, people have taken out larger and larger loans to afford housing, while speculators have invested heavily in property, also using loaned money. Right now, this is coming to an end, fast. The prices are dropping, and people are trying to sell like there is no tomorrow. Many less fortunates will be stuck with huge loans they can't repay. As people are cursing both [Root.GetLeader] and the [Root.GetAdjective] Central Bank for causing this, we must make an public statement on how we intend to handle this crisis fast."
 econvent.2.a:0 "We will flood the system with cheap money to make the market bounce back"

 econvent.3.t:0 "Stock Market Crash"
 econvent.3.d:0 "It seems the chaos following the bursting of the housing-bubble has reached the Stock Market. The share prices of nearly all listed [Root.GetAdjective] companies tumbled down heavily this morning, and our currency fell a great deal too. Trading was temporarly suspended before lunch, but no improvement is expected once markets re-open tomorrow as everyone is desperate to sell their stocks."

Desperate financial moguls, their lobbyists, and the politicians they have made contributions to - all are swarming the [Root.GetAdjective] governing officies, and all have the same message: "We need a bailout!". \n \nApparently the dual shock of the Housing Downturn and the Stock Market Crash were too much for the financial sector to handle. The buildup of bad debts from their speculation is simply too great, there needs to be an inflow of fresh government money - or there will be bankrupcies across the board with innocent savers losing their deposits."

 econvent.5.t:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] Consumers Spend Less"
 econvent.5.d:0 "A recent report highlighted that the hard-working [Root.GetAdjective] people are increasingly worried about their future. This pessimism is causing people to save more, and overall consumption is down. If this continues, a lot of businesses in [Root.GetName] will have to downsize or close down. Businesses that mainly exports [Root.GetAdjective] goods are however, not affected by this."

 econvent.6.d:0 "The data is clear; the international exports of [Root.GetName] are going down. The cause, however, is being hotly debated amongst [Root.GetLeader]'s economic advicers. One theory is that we have become less competetive due to our relative high wages, another is that our competitors have increased the quality of their products. Others feel that the decrease in demand is just due to shifting trends abroad. Whatever the cause, there is not really much we can do about this except putting it behind us and working harder in the future."

 econvent.7.d:0 "While we usually don't get much rain, the rainfall this growing season has been absymal, with most crops failing. What little agricultural produce has been produced is entirely due to remaining rivers and artificial irrigation, something that is sadly not very common here in [Root.GetName]. Farmers are demanding aid from the [Root.GetLeader] Government, and city dwellers are getting worried about rising food prices."

 Yemen.3.d:0 "With the war won, the time has come to rebuild our country that we fought so desperately to free from it's misguided leadership. Our associates from the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, an interim government that we had put in place amidst the civil war, remind us of their contribution to the war effort and urge us to carry out our original plan of dividing our presidential council equally between both parties. Let us remember that a number of these men were among those we started this fight against, and those we could not maintain a stable alliance with. We cannot forsee the future, but allowing them a seat in our parliament may very well lead us back into the uncertainty we sought to destroy."
