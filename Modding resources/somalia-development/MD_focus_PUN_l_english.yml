 ##Puntland Monetary Decisions
 puntland_money.1.t: "The Deferral"
 puntland_money.1.d: "Given our current economic situation, and with refugees pouring across the border into our country we have to make a few decisions. The first is the option of deferral. Much like how other countries take on debt to finance operations. We have devised a way of processing payment to our various vendors and our government functions thorugh the process of deferment. If we defer payment to the local populace and use this as a form of betterment to the people then we can continue to grow. However, this is often seen as corrupt and unjust to not pay for goods upfront with no promise of payment. The alternative is normal spending which can lead our already fragile nation to collapse."
