 native_inuit_spiritualism_desc:0 "Inuit spiritualism is a comprised of local folklore and mythologies that have been recited orally by generations of shamans and elders dating back thousands of years. The Inuit believe in a pantheon of deities that preside over the occurences of natural phenomenon and of the environment and also believe that within living entities, be it an animal, human, supernatual entity, and even plants contain within them a spirit or 'breath' known as 'Anirniit'. It is said that because everything has a spirit, it's considered just as grave offence to kill another lifeform without following proper rituals, as it is no different to killing a fellow human. The 'anirniit' is considered as an integral part of the surrounding ambience known as 'Sila', and many Inuit pay tribute and gain charactarisics of a certain spirit by taking its name or further more invoked by those who share a connection to the spirit."
