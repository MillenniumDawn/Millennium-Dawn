 AST_Final_Years_of_Howards_Second_Term: "Turbulent Times"
 AST_Final_Years_of_Howards_Second_Term_desc: "As Australia approaches the 2001 federal elections, John Howard is an unpopular prime minister, who many want to see resign or be voted out of office. There is also high dissatisfaction with the Liberal/National coalition. A big question on voters minds is if the country's second biggest airline, Ansett Australia, should be bailed out. Labour supports a bailout because it would represent a significant loss of jobs, but the ruling coalition does not since they do not see it as the governments fault."

Labour supports a bailout because it would represent a significant loss of jobs, but the ruling coalition does not since they do not see it as the governments fault."
 AST_The_Effects_of_GST: "The Effects of GST"
 AST_The_Effects_of_GST_desc: "A Goods and Services Tax, or a GST, is similar to what many Europeans would call a Value-Added Tax or (VAT). The Howard government passed legislation to establish a GST on 28 June 1999 as A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999. It gained assent on 8 July 1999 and came into operation on 1 July 2000. The government initially said that exemptions to GST were not possible, and hoped to pass the GST legislation with the support of independent Senator Harradine, but he ultimately voted against the legislation. However a compromise was eventually reached, involving most basic food items being exempt from GST, the GST on library purchases of books being refunded, a temporary 8% refund on school textbooks, increases to welfare payments, and greater powers to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission to oversee the implementation of the new tax regime."
 AST_Working_with_the_Party: "Working with the Party"
 AST_Working_with_the_Party_desc: "As 2001 approaches, John Howard wants to work with the Liberal/National coalition to consolidate his power and position him and his party in a good position for the upcoming elections."
 AST_Preparing_for_the_Election: "Preparing for the Election"
 AST_Preparing_for_the_Election_desc: "As the election drew nearer, excitement reached a fever pitch. The incumbent, boasting a track record of achievements, found themselves in a fierce competition with a range of challengers. The electorate was gripped by the suspense of the impending vote, with all eyes on the candidates, eager to see who would emerge victorious."
 AST_The_Labor_Party: "The Labor Party"
 AST_The_Labor_Party_desc: "The Australian Labor Party is the major center-left opposition party. The party balances progressive and centrist policies between its factions. The left faction is progressive and socially democratic, while the right faction is economically liberal and socially conservative."
 AST_Strengthen_the_Labor_right: "Strengthen the Labor Right"
 AST_Strengthen_the_Labor_right_desc: "Labor's Right focuses on economic growth, fiscal responsibility and market-friendly policies. Their policies prioritise budget surplus and debt reduction with more cautious climate policy and a more restrictive approach to immigration and border security. They strongly support the US alliance and close ties to Western allies."
 AST_Increase_the_power_of_the_Labor_left: "Increase the Power of the Labor Left"
 AST_Increase_the_power_of_the_Labor_left_desc: "Labor's Left is more progressive and social-democratic than the Right. The faction emphasises social justice, equality and the rights of marginalized groups. Their economic policy advocates for stronger government intervention to ensure fair distribution of wealth and resources. They support a more independent foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States."
 AST_influence_the_factions: "Influence the Factions"
 AST_influence_the_factions_desc: ""
 AST_Branch_Stacking: "Branch Stacking"
 AST_Branch_Stacking_desc: "To ensure the Labor Party's success in future elections, we should position loyal party members in branches where their votes can significantly impact the outcome of internal party elections in our favour. This will allow us to ensure that our preferred candidates are preselected for elections and ensure that our faction gains control over party decisions. The practice is considered unethical and risks increasing the country's political corruption."
 AST_Influence_the_Unions: "Influence the Unions"
 AST_Influence_the_Unions_desc: "The Labor Party has a long history with Australia's labour unions. The unions have large numbers of members that could benefit our cause monetarily and politically. Supporting the unions gives us legitimacy as representatives of the working-class's interests."
 AST_Use_the_faceless_men: "Use the Faceless Men"
 AST_Use_the_faceless_men_desc: "Senior party officials, faction leaders and union bosses exert substantial control over the party's internal processes. These men and women can make backroom deals to influence key decisions that affect the party's direction and leadership without input from the general public."
 AST_Push_Social_issues_into_the_party_platform: "Promote Social Issues"
 AST_Push_Social_issues_into_the_party_platform_desc: "A key priority of Labor's Left is a progressive approach to social issues. The Labor Party should make social issues a major part of our platform."
 AST_Expand_the_power_of_the_trade_unions_in_the_party: "Expand the Power of Trade Unions"
 AST_Expand_the_power_of_the_trade_unions_in_the_party_desc: "Trade unions fight for worker's rights, fair wages, job security and better working conditions. Their interests align with our own and giving them more power in the party will make them more invested in our success. We may have to compromise on some issues to keep them on our side, and the public may develop a perception that our party is under their control."
 AST_Look_towards_Keynesianism: "Look Towards Keynesianism"
 AST_Look_towards_Keynesianism_desc: "Keynesianism is an economic philosophy that is focused on aggregate demand, the idea that total demand for goods and services is the primary driver of economic activity and employment levels. The philosophy advocates for active government intervention to keep the economy stable. Countercyclical spending is a core concept that encourages governments to spend more and lower taxes during the bad times, and the reverse during economic booms. Our government should look to Keynes's wisdom when considering macroeconomic policies."
 AST_Push_for_slow_change_in_the_party: "Encourage A Conservative Approach"
 AST_Push_for_slow_change_in_the_party_desc: "While Labor is a left leaning party, we should take a slower approach to our social policies to avoid alienating potential voters. The Labor Party should support traditional family values and take a controlled approach to issues like immigration and border security. Centrist social policies will be more palatable to more voters."
 AST_Keep_with_the_Third_way: "Keep with the Third Way"
 AST_Keep_with_the_Third_way_desc: "Traditional socialism and laissez-faire capitalism have too many flaws to be effective in the modern day. The Third Way is an attempt to reconcile right and left-wing policies in the social, economic and welfare spheres of government. We will focus on pragmatic, evidence-based policymaking rather than ideological purity."
 AST_Continue_US_focused_foreign_policy: "US Foreign Policy Alignment"
 AST_Continue_US_focused_foreign_policy_desc: "The US's success is our success. We should continue to align our foreign policy with that of the United States to ensure our security and prosperity."
 AST_Push_the_ideas_of_New_Leftism: "The Ideas of New Leftism"
 AST_Push_the_ideas_of_New_Leftism_desc: "The New Left is a political movement that attempts to put a greater focus on civil rights, environmentalism and cultural liberation, areas often neglected by the Old Left. The Labor Party will push for racial and gender equality, environmental protection and anti-imperialism. We should be wary of capitalism and decentralise political power to give communities more control over their own affairs."
 AST_Bring_Tax_reform_to_the_table: "Put Tax Reform on the Table"
 AST_Bring_Tax_reform_to_the_table_desc: "Increase taxes for the wealthy, tax cuts for the poor. A man only needs so much wealth before it becomes significant excess. Low-income workers keep the country running, and we should minimise the economic burden they carry. We can put this money to good use in education and healthcare."
 AST_Sway_support_from_the_unions: "Persuade the Unions"
 AST_Sway_support_from_the_unions_desc: "The unions give the working man a way to balance the scales against wealthy employers. But even the unions need a representative in politics and government. If we pledge to fight for their interests, they will fight for ours. We can start by focusing on protections for workers, investment in training and apprenticeship programs, and opposing anti-union legislation."
 AST_Keep_with_economic_rationalism: "Adhere to Economic Rationalism"
 AST_Keep_with_economic_rationalism_desc: "Regulation in the economy causes unnecessary inefficiencies. Let the free market decide where resources can be best spent. With strong competition, the private sector will be more efficient than the state could ever be. Inequality may increase, but it's necessary to push the whole country further."
 AST_Push_the_balance_of_power_towards_the_left: "Tip the Balance to the Left"
 AST_Push_the_balance_of_power_towards_the_left_desc: "The ideals of Labor's Left will become the party's primary platform. Social justice, equality and the rights of the marginalised. The weak should be raised up and the strong should be held accountable."
 AST_Push_the_balance_of_power_towards_the_right: "Tip the Balance to the Right"
 AST_Push_the_balance_of_power_towards_the_right_desc: "For a fair and rational world, Labor's Right will become the party's primary concern. Economic growth, fiscal responsibility and market-friendly policies. The economy should be strong and the government should be small."
 AST_Implement_the_policies_of_the_Labor_party: "Implement Labor Policies"
 AST_Implement_the_policies_of_the_Labor_party_desc: "Now that Labor's in power, it's time to deliver on the promises we made to the Australian people. There will certainly be some controversy, but hard truths require harder choices."
 AST_Revitalise_Labors_economic_policy: "Revitalise Labor's Economic Policy"
 AST_Revitalise_Labors_economic_policy_desc: "The country needs a new economic direction. John Howard's policies were a disaster for the country, fraught with privatisation and deregulation. Under our opponent's rule, less people than ever can afford homes and they've not so much flirted with, as stomped all over worker's rights. That's not to mention the lack of investment in public infrastructure and services which are now causing major bottlenecks in efficiency."
 AST_Refund_the_underfunded_social_services: "Reinvigorate Underfunded Social Services"
 AST_Refund_the_underfunded_social_services_desc: "Years of tight budgeting have left the country's social services in a degraded state. The effects of lacking social services reach far and wide, from increased crime to long-term educational deficits. We need to plan for the long term success of the country, and not just the next election cycle."
 AST_Cement_a_Foreign_Policy: "Cement a Foreign Policy"
 AST_Cement_a_Foreign_Policy_desc: "Australia is a small fish in a big pond. We need to ensure we're swimming in the right direction, lest we get swallowed by a hungry shark. We need to decide who our friends are, and more importantly, who our enemies will be."
 AST_Create_consensus_on_domestic_issues: "Create Consensus on Domestic Issues"
 AST_Create_consensus_on_domestic_issues_desc: "Australia is a geographically large country with an increasingly diverse population. There are a number of pressing social issues that we need to confront as we move into the future."

 AST_The_greens_desc: "The Australian Greens, commonly referred to simply as the Greens, are a confederation of Green state and territory political parties in Australia. As the 2001 federal elections approaches, they currently have almost no representation in either the House of Representatives or the Senate, holding onto only one Senate seat during the 1998 elections. But they are hoping to turn that around this time"
 AST_Promote_environmental_consciousness: "Promote Environmental Consciousness"
 AST_Promote_environmental_consciousness_desc:  " As an environmentally focused party, it is the Green Partys job and duty to promote environmental consciousness amongst the Australian public. Although they still currently lack representation in the House and lack meaningful representation in the Senate, leading up to the upcoming 2001 elections, as part of our campaigning for the election, and in general, it is good for the party to promote the idea of environmental consciousness to the Australian public."
 AST_grnInfluence_the_Unions: "Influence the Unions"
 AST_grnInfluence_the_Unions_desc: "Australia has a strong history of unions, dating back to the 1853 with the Amalgamated Engineering Union, which was formed in Sydney in 1852 by 27 members of the British union who had emigrated to Australia following a work stoppage initiated by the management of a company during a labour dispute, in Britain. It may be a good idea for the Green Party to work with the unions to establish popular support amongst union members and union supporters more generally for the Australian Greens, and also to establish potential donors from the unions and their members."
 AST_Connect_with_the_Youth: "Connect with the Youth"

It is time that the Green Party investigates if there are firms that may form what economists call oligopolies in specific industries or across the economy, and break up “big business” if needed."
