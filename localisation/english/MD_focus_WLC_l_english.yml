mircea_chelaru_desc: "Born in the village of Rediu in Jassy County, Mircea Chelaru was an average student at Alecsandri High before joining the Military School in Kimpolung. Something must have awakened in him there, as he decided to dedicate himself and his life to a career in the military. After completing his military studies, he quickly rose through the ranks, first becoming a lieutenant in 1977, then an officer in 1978, and eventually a brigadier general by 1997, followed by his promotion to divisional general in 1999.\n\nNaturally, all these honors and distinctions soon attracted the attention of Bucharest, which appointed him Chief of Staff in early 2000. However, Chelaru was soon dismissed following a series of bellicose statements and the exposure of his role in the Targu Mures clashes, which resulted in five deaths and hundreds of injuries. Still, after Vadim was elected President, he insisted on reappointing Chelaru as Chief of Staff due to their ideological similarities. Following the failed March on Bucharest and nationwide riots, Chelaru led a coup to remove Vadim and restore a sense of 'normality'. Initially, the population greeted the news with ecstasy, hoping for a restoration of democracy. However, when it became clear that Chelaru was merely another dictator, riots and violence resumed. Attempts to restore order failed as military units began switching sides, plunging Romania into a civil war.\n\nNow, with the situation stabilized and control over what remains of Romania, Chelaru looks to make his next move."
