# Devolution Mechanic:
# Agitation = how annoying they are, basically, higher agitation means more harsher punishments for when they go against you
# -------------- HOW AGITATION WORKS -------------- #
# [-] Agitation will grow from certain focuses/events/decisions etc
# - Agitation will be lowered over time naturally
# - If you maintain a high level of agitation for a while, you'll get random events that increase nationalism
# - Coupled with random naitonalism events, you get debuffs anytime they are pissed
# - If nationalism is above 85% for too long, Agitation will start growing randomly anywhere between 1-3 every month
# - Agitation can be lowered by a lot by lower their dependency
# -------------- HOW DEPENDENCY WORKS -------------- #
# [-] Dependency is lower or increased via the focus tree (A Variable out of 100 with 3 stages)
# - In the focus tree, there will be 2 trees, 1 for pro-devolve and 1 for against per region
# - The paths are made available based on party ideology
# - Focuses will unlock decisions that count as laws that you could pass (Either pro or anti devolution laws)
# - Some of these decisions are permanent/irreversable laws, EX: Reducing Scottish parliament seats (Will get to this later)
# - Will have 1 for Scots, Welsh, and Irish
# --- Government Change in the middle of devolution ---
# [-] Gives Spirit "Promises of Devolution"
# --- What if you change governments from anti-devolution party to pro-devolution? --- #
# - After change of govt. If you already went down dickstomping devolution, it gives you an event that pops up and says:
# "Scottish seats will support you if you revert the fuck up of previous administration" (Halting Devolution). If you say accept,
# But continue devolved policies, then the Scots agitation will increase by 2X anytime they get pissed (EX: 1 agitation is now 2)
# But if you keep your promise, it will bring their agitation down and you get support from them.
# You will also get decisions to repeal certain laws that will decrease their dependency on the U.K.
# If you reject their request, you can just go down the devolution path the previous admininistration started
# If you for some reason bring back the anti-devolution party, you then get those laws (decisions) you got from focuses
# You will NOT get the decisions for the permanent decisions, this goes for both pro and anti devolution parties
# --- What if you change governments from pro-devolution party to anti-devolution? --- #
# - Gets event that lets you make a promise that you won't clamp down on progress made on devolution
# - You will be able to repeal certain laws as stated from before, as mentioned before if you decide to clamp down
# If promise is granted and you don't reverse devolution, agitation will decrease BUT it will give an equilibrium toward devolution
# If you decide to continue going the route of dick-stomping devolution, then you will start losing party popularity
# Dependency levels will decide independence levels
# - Dependent is when the constituent is in your land (not on the game map)
# - Semi - Dependent is any of the 4 autonomy levels (on the map, but they are a puppet)
# The autonomy levels will dynamically shift as the player goes deeper into devolution
# Idea is to encourage as low as possible on devolution to maximize bonuses towards the player
# Bonuses include %'s of GDP and Commonwealth nation member states which will ultimately help the U.K.
# Will also give option to force Wales & Northern Ireland to use the British Pound
# - Independent is idk take a wild guess
# -------------- HOW NATIONALISM WORKS -------------- #
# [-] Nationalism will decide whether or not the constituent will declare a referendum
# - Nationalism will grow upon doing moves that anger the constituent
# - Possible causes for nationalism are:
# Certain events/focuses/decisions that may cause harm to that constituent
# Beginning to back peddle on devolution or trying to curb it entirely
# Going to War
# - If nationalism hits 100, they will run a referendum that you then have to ratify
# Agitation will decide their reaction to your decision on referendum
# Low agitation if Rejected: non-violent protest movements (damage to economy basically)
# high agitation if rejected: Car bombings every other day & chance of revolt upon rejection (car bombings still follow)
# Low agitation if accepted: Devolve with a lot of control (This is basically outcome if u just do everything to devolve)
# High agitation if accepted: Devolve with less control (this is if they hit u w/the referendum and u accept)
# -------------- Focus Tree -------------- #
# Once someone goes down the path of either devolving or not, if they decide to nothing and edge the system, they'll get devolution fallout spirit x10
# -------------- MISC -------------- #
# [-] Add game rule that lets you spell Scotland will let you spell Scotland with 2 T's
# - If made available, all your leaders and generals get renamed to "Scott"

# Westmister Mechanic
# Main Parties: Conservatives, labour, Lib-Dem
# Smaller parties: Commie Coalition, UKIP, Greens, BNP & SNP
# Elections
# Hung Parliament if majority is not met
# Have the 650 seats and then figure out %'s of how much each party got in each election to figure out winner
# Divide 650 by party pop by each slot
# Wales and scotland: Take Party Pop, but then you take away the nationalists % Variable and then the remainder of the % left are given to the nationalist parties
# - Change the GUI for NIR to split nationalism into 3 bars, Unionism, Non-Sectarianism, & Republicanism
# - Make 3 seperate variables.
# If you go against devolution you support unionists
# If you go further devolution you can support the Republicans & Non Sectarians
# These 3 seperate variables will decide end state for NIR
# 18 NIR Seats, and take 3 variables and divide them against 18 (Based on actual variables)
# 59 Scottish (Based on actual nationalism VAR)
# 40 Welsh (Based on actual nationalism VAR)
# Whoever wins the election loses one seat as they get a speaker
# English seats: (Take Party Popularity variable) (if minor -, if major +) ( random variable selected from range of 0-10)
# (Take Party Popularity of Labour,Tories,LibDems,Greens) (then Combine) (then add Nationalist Percentage) (remainder randomly distributed)
# FUTURE ADDITIONS: Good to get UI to expand to states within England
