 hongkong_news.8.t: "Severe Tropical Storm Utor"
 hongkong_news.8.d: "On July 4 at 5:45 PM, Typhoon Yuet entered the 800-kilometer warning zone, prompting the Hong Kong Observatory to issue a Standby Signal No.1. On July 5 at 7:30 PM, the signal was upgraded to Gale Or Storm Signal No.8, marking the first issuance of this signal in the 21st century. Due to storm surges, the combination of the storm surge and the normal high tide on that morning resulted in a sea level of 3.4 meters recorded at Quarry Bay, the highest since Typhoon Wanda hit Hong Kong in 1962. This led to severe flooding in Tai O and the northwestern New Territories on July 6. Some main streets in Tai O turned into rivers, with water depths reaching up to three meters. The seafood wholesale market in Lau Fau Shan was also flooded, forcing many shops to close." #7月4日下午5时45分，尤特进入800公里警戒线，香港天文台悬挂一号戒备信号。7月5日晚上7时30分改挂八号烈风或暴风信号，成为21世纪以来天文台首次八号烈风或暴风信号。受风暴潮影响，风暴潮加在该日早上的正常涨潮，令鲗鱼涌测得3.4米海平面高度。成为自1962年台风温黛袭港以来维港测得的最高海平面高度。引致7月6日在大澳及新界西北地区严重洪涝。大澳部分主要街道变为河道，水深一度达三米。流浮山海鲜批发市场亦被海水淹浸，众多商铺被逼关闭。
