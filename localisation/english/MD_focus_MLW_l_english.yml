 # MCP
 MLW_MCP.0.t: "The Party of Hastings Banda"
 MLW_MCP.0.d: "The Malawian Congress Party is a name synonymous with polarisation; both the liberators, and the oppressors, the freedom fighters, and the human rights abusers.\n\nThis all changed in 1993, with the referendum held, and passed, the one party rule of Hastings Kamuzu Banda, ended. With the first free and fair elections held in which the UDF trounced the MCP singlehandedly, the MCP was solidified as \"The Second Party\" in a largely bimodal electoral cycle.\n\nWill the new Millennium see the MCP rise to greatness once more? Or will they fade into obscurity?"
 MLW_MCP.0.O1: "Only time will tell..."

 MLW_MCP.1.t: "Building Banda's Mausoleum"
 MLW_MCP.1.d: "Kamuzu Banda is an extremely polarising figure within Malawi and even abroad. On one hand he led the nation out of colonial rule, but on the other, he was an extremely authoritarian leader.\n\nIt is difficult to say what should be done here, but whether we choose to build an opulent mausoleum to the first President of Malawi or not, his legacy has deep rooted influences within the minds of Africans everywhere."
 MLW_MCP.1.O1: "Building the mausoleum is the least we can do."
 MLW_MCP.1.O2: "Not everyone wants to be reminded of Banda."

 MLW_MCP.2.t: "MCP Leadership Debate Heats Up!"
 MLW_MCP.2.d: "Currently the MCP is seeing some great successes with Gwanda Chakuamba's guidance, but some within the party wish for a return to the old reign, with a challenge coming from the hardliner faction head and former second in command to Hastings Banda; John Tembo, who should we put our backing towards?"
 MLW_MCP.2.O1: "Chakuamba's doing a fine job, keep it up!"
 MLW_MCP.2.O2: "The right hand man becomes the main man!"
 MLW_MCP.2.O3: "Is there a third option?"

 MLW_MCP.20.t: "Chakuamba Maintains The MCP Leadership!"
 MLW_MCP.20.d: "After all the ballots were counted and tallied up, Gwanda Chakuamba easily maintained his position as leader of the MCP, many hardliners have seemingly took issue with this and left the party itself, though this is barely a concern for the grander scheme of things."
 MLW_MCP.20.O1: "Congratulations to Chakuamba!"

 MLW_MCP.21.t: "Tembo Cynches The Leader Spot!"
 MLW_MCP.21.d: "After all the ballots were counted and tallied up, John Tembo looks to have clutched onto the leadership spot after a hard fought battle, some more moderate members have seen this as a worrying turn of events. The hardliners have easily filled their ranks."
 MLW_MCP.21.O1: "Congratulations to Tembo!"

 MLW_MCP.200.t: "Jumani Johansson Arrives"
 MLW_MCP.200.d: "A man purporting to be an illegitimate son of the former president; Hastings Banda has arrived in Malawi, he is causing quite the commotion with both Kamuzuist supporters and the press alike."
 MLW_MCP.200.O1: "But Banda never had children..."

 MLW_MCP.3.t1: "Tembo Seizes the Reins!"
 MLW_MCP.3.d1: "John Tembo has orchestrated an internal coup against the current leader of the MCP, with some moderates afraid of the repercussions, the people are awaiting the eventual outcomes of this interparty reshuffling..."

 MLW_MCP.3.t2: "Tembo's MCP Launches Investigations"
 MLW_MCP.3.d2: "When John Tembo took the leadership spot during interparty elections, there was some fearmongering from moderate factions that Tembo may return to Kamuzuist era policies. Sadly those same moderates seem far too willing to commit terrible acts against Malawi and its people!\n\nHaving found evidence of an coup attempt from Chakuamba loyalists, Tembo has seized the opportunity to punish this terrible act of treason severely!"
 MLW_MCP.3.O1: "Good riddance!"

 MLW_MCP.4.t: "A Ceremonial Position"
 MLW_MCP.4.d: "Jumani Johansson is not yet fit for a leadership role within the MCP, and as such should be given some do nothing role, perhaps we can put him in charge of HR, those people do nothing useful anyway, we'll give some pomp to the title, that should keep the people (and Johansson) happy."
 MLW_MCP.4.O1: "How does Chief Inspiration Officer sound?"

 MLW_MCP.5.t: "The Pretender"
 MLW_MCP.5.d: "Officially, Hastings Banda never had children and died unmarried, and yet, a pretender to Banda's name has arrived, requesting, nay, begging the Banda family to allow for a DNA test to find the truth, the family seem reluctant, but the MCP could sway them with some spiel about \"cultural and historial significance\", or... we could let dead men's seed tell no tales."
 MLW_MCP.5.O1: "The truth will set us free, from not knowing!"
 MLW_MCP.5.O2: "This is silly, deport Johansson."

 MLW_MCP.50.t: "Banda... IS The Father!"
 MLW_MCP.50.d: "After the tests came back... the results were simple, clear, and obvious.\n\nHastings Banda did in fact have at least one child; Jumani Johansson."
 MLW_MCP.50.O1: "The similarities are undeniable!"

 MLW_MCP.51.t: "Banda... Is NOT The Father!"
 MLW_MCP.51.d: "The tests have come back, and the results may not be what Jumani Johansson expected, nor wanted. Hastings Banda officially remains, childless.\n\nInterestingly enough, Johansson seems taken in by our great nation, and wishes to remain within, even seeking citizenship, what should we do?"
 MLW_MCP.51.O1: "Johansson may not be a Banda, but he can stay anyway."
 MLW_MCP.51.O2: "Load him onto the first flight out of here!"

 MLW_MCP.6.t: "Johansson-Banda Gains The MCP Leadership!" # fix - make a backup description in case of returning DNA negative
 MLW_MCP.6.d: "After the DNA tests came back positive, it was an inevitability that many within the party would want Johansson-Banda to take the top spot, and today it was made a reality, now comes the hard choice of whether to allow Tembo to serve his term as President of Malawi or to \"encourage\" the old man to take an early retirement in lieu of Banda's heir."
 MLW_MCP.6.O1: "Step aside old man!"
 MLW_MCP.6.O2: "Tembo was elected, Tembo will serve."

 MLW_MCP.7.t: "Searching For the Perpetrators of Operation Bwezani"
 MLW_MCP.7.d: "Shortly before the ridiculous referendum of 1993 was Operation Bwezani, a treasonous plot from within the military to disarm and disband the MYP, now that our MYP are back and better armed than ever, some within the party believe that the military may end up trying a new Operation similar, and should stop it before it has the chance to start."
 MLW_MCP.7.O1: "The search begins..."
 MLW_MCP.7.O2: "Is it worth it?"

 MLW_MCP.70.t: "Purging Bwezani Sympathising Party Members"
 MLW_MCP.70.d: "This was an easy one to start with, we will unravel the tapestry of deceit from within. There are some treasonous members of the MCP who sympathise with the Bwezani pepetrators, this is a terrible thing, and they must be purged, one way or the other..."
 MLW_MCP.70.O1: "What leads did they give us?"
 MLW_MCP.70.O2: "This seems to be enough."

 MLW_MCP.71.t: "Removing Bwezani Sympathising Educators"
 MLW_MCP.71.d: "Sadly some of the people supposedly expected to educate the next generations of Malawians and MCP members have failed in their duties. They teach Operation Bwezani as a good thing!\n\nThankfully we have classrooms of our own for the re-education of these treasonous teachers..."
 MLW_MCP.71.O1: "Who else needs a lesson?"
 MLW_MCP.71.O2: "We've done all that was needed."

 MLW_MCP.700.t: "Toppling The Military"
 MLW_MCP.700.d: "Last but not least, we have cornered the seditious members of the military responsible for the violence against our beloved MYP, we can't be sure if we've gotten them all though.\n\nPerhaps integrating the MYP as the offical armed forces will help matters?"
 MLW_MCP.700.O1: "A wonderful idea! Replace the traitors!"
 MLW_MCP.700.O2: "The can remain independent... for now."

 MLW_MCP.8.t: "Authoritarianism in Africa"
 MLW_MCP.8.d: "Authoritarianism has a tried and true history in Africa and the world generally, but we're at a crossroads, do we accept the authoritarians, or do we seek it for ourselves?"
 MLW_MCP.8.O1: "Tolerance is the best for good relations."
 MLW_MCP.8.O2: "Authoritarianism is just a synonym for correct."

 MLW_MCP.9.t: "Tackling the Communist Scourge"
 MLW_MCP.9.d: "Kamuzuist policy on communists was simple: \"There are no good communists\", we should look into various groups within Malawi and see if they are seditious enough to warrant outlawing their party."
 MLW_MCP.9.O1: "We shouldn't need to look too hard."
 MLW_MCP.9.O2: "Let's be safe rather than sorry."

 MLW_MCP.10.t: "Moving Away From Banda's Shadow"
 MLW_MCP.10.d: "Hastings Banda was the first President of Malawi, a liberator of the Malawian peoples and yet, a ruthless dictator.\n\nWith conservative dress codes and a one party state, some in the party want to maintain ties to Kamuzuist doctrines, largely believing that Malawians really do miss his iron grip. Others however see Kamuzuist era policies as holding Malawi back from achieving its true greatness."
 MLW_MCP.10.O1: "Democracy must be upheld."
 MLW_MCP.10.O2: "In the words of Osho, \"but the people are...\""

 MLW_MCP.11.t: "The First of The Four"
 MLW_MCP.11.d: "Our \"Four Enemies\" initiative is off to a roaring start, the people are anxiously awaiting direction as to what the MCP will attempt to eradicate first: corruption, disease, hunger, or the lack of shelter."
 MLW_MCP.11.O1: "It must be brought into the light!"
 MLW_MCP.11.O2: "Never another preventable death!"
 MLW_MCP.11.O3: "No Malawian will go hungry again!"
 MLW_MCP.11.O4: "The MCP will be the roof over Malawi's head!"

 MLW_MCP.12.t: "Hardliners Offer a \"Helping Hand\""
 MLW_MCP.12.d: "Some of the hardliners have come to the office of the President and offered some monetary incentives to look the other way whilst they do what they call \"just business\", obviously this is a bribe but can we turn it down?"
 MLW_MCP.12.O1: "That sounds like a great idea..."
 MLW_MCP.12.O2: "What? Fire them!"

 MLW_MCP.13.t: "Medicine Distribution Pays Off"
 MLW_MCP.13.d: "The distribution of medicine to those hardest hit by disease has been a blessing, the people of Malawi are extraordinarily grateful and as an aside, seem to be healthier and fitter than before, allowing us to save in the long run on health costs."
 MLW_MCP.13.O1: "We knew it would work!"

 MLW_MCP.14.t: "Farming Subsidies Comes to a Close"
 MLW_MCP.14.d: "With the end of farming subsidies, comes a significant boost to the agricultural sector, farmers are reporting bumper crops and as a result, more tax revenues for the government, this was an extremely costly endeavour, but it paid off in the end."
 MLW_MCP.14.O1: "Good job! Next time we'll stop for photos!"

 MLW_MCP.15.t: "Clearing The Slums"
 MLW_MCP.15.d: "This is a very unpopular policy, but it needs to be done, the people living within the slums will need to be moved in order for progress to move forwards as a nation."
 MLW_MCP.15.O1: "Let's hope the media don't catch wind of this."

 MLW_MCP.150.t: "New Clearances"
 MLW_MCP.150.d1: "Some of the slums in the North of Malawi have been cleared away, presenting a golden opportunity for developers to build anew."
 MLW_MCP.150.d2: "Some of the slums in the South of Malawi have been cleared away, presenting a golden opportunity for developers to build anew."
 MLW_MCP.150.O1: "Hopefully the former residents don't mind."

 MLW_MCP.16.t: "Supreme Court Blocks Law!"
 MLW_MCP.16.d: "Those uptight sods in the Supreme Court have blocked the law we are trying to pass, absurdly they say it is \"undemocratic\", what do they know? With their fancy wigs and silly red robes?"
 MLW_MCP.16.O1: "We'll have to try again with the law rewritten..."

 MLW_MCP.17.t: "Protestors Complain About Law!"
 MLW_MCP.17.d: "The people are complaining about our most recent attempts to pass a law, something or other about it they deem \"undemocratic\", but what do they know? Some within government are saying we should listen to their demands to change parts of it, but we're not sure..."
 MLW_MCP.17.O1: "Ignore them, they don't know anything!"
 MLW_MCP.17.O2: "Perhaps we should rewrite it a little..."













































 # UDF
 MLW_UDF.0.t: "The First President of Malawi"
 MLW_UDF.0.d: "Bakili Muluzi currently resides as not only the president of the UDF, but also the president of Malawi.\n\nThe United Democratic Front (UDF) is the first democratically elected party since the collapse of the one party state thanks to the §HReferendum of 1993§!. This puts the UDF in a unique position to kickstart the Malawian path to greatness, although there are criticisms from various parties regarding how much control the Muluzi family have over the party, and therefore the nation..."
 MLW_UDF.0.O1: "The UDF will lead Malawi to victory!"

 MLW_UDF.1.t: "What To Do With The Grain Reserves?"
 MLW_UDF.1.d: "The grain reserves of Malawi are filled to the brim, and many within the UDF are calling for this untapped wealth to be utilised properly, Muluzi has the final say but opposition parties are calling for these reserves to remain at all costs, lest we suffer a drought or famine."
 MLW_UDF.1.O1: "We have plenty to spare, don't be silly!"
 MLW_UDF.1.O2: "Well what if the rains aren't blessed?"

 MLW_UDF.10.t: "Wheeling and Dealing, Malawian Style"
 MLW_UDF.10.d: "A small fortune was made from the grain reserves being sold off, though the question is now who will take a hold of the profits, Muluzi has graciously offered to be the warden of the profits, though opposition parties are calling shenanigans before any decision has been made, and are demanding the profits go into the treasury directly."
 MLW_UDF.10.O1: "We trust Muluzi and his extended family with wardenship."
 MLW_UDF.10.O2: "Straight into the treasury vault it goes!"

 MLW_UDF.2.t: "Bakili and The Courts"
 MLW_UDF.2.d: "Bakili Muluzi is currently running through his second term as president of Malawi, the current consitution restricts presidents to only 2 terms, much like the United States, although the constitution of Malawi is far easier to change, in theory.\n\nMuluzi wishes to change the constitution to allow him to run for a third term. The opposition parties, most of the courts and unfortunately, a lot of the voters are against such a change, what can we do?"
 MLW_UDF.2.O1: "If only we could find a loophole..."
 MLW_UDF.2.O2: "We should put it to a referendum, like 1993!"
 MLW_UDF.2.O3: "Cram it through, Muluzi knows best!"
 MLW_UDF.2.O4: "Follow the constitution, it's what it's there for anyway."

 MLW_UDF.20.t1: "A Loophole Has Been Found!"
 MLW_UDF.20.d1: "Our top legal experts have found a loophole in the wording of the constitution that seemingly invalidates the term limitations, allowing Bakili Muluzi to run for another term without putting it to a vote or using underhanded tactics! The opposition might not enjoy it but the law is the law after all, no one can argue otherwise!"
 MLW_UDF.20.O1: "I wonder what else is invalidated in this constitution..."

 MLW_UDF.20.t2: "We Cannot Find A Loophole!"
 MLW_UDF.20.d2: "Despite our best efforts, we cannot find a loophole in the constitution regarding term limits, we can either put it to a vote now with reduced time to prepare a campaign trail, or begin to search for a successor to Muluzi ahead of the upcoming elections."
 MLW_UDF.20.O2: "Let's set up that referendum shall we?"
 MLW_UDF.20.O3: "Step aside old man!"

 MLW_UDF.20.t3: "The Campaign Trail Begins Soon!"
 MLW_UDF.20.d3: "Putting the constitutional changes to a referendum should negate a lot of the possible backlash from opposition parties and judges, if we do it legally, we aren't corrupt. Right? ...right?"
 MLW_UDF.20.O4: "It's heating up!"

 MLW_UDF.20.t4: "Opposition Parties and Populous Are Outraged!"
 MLW_UDF.20.d4: "During the most recent hearing in the National Assembly, opposition leaders from both [MLW.Neutral_conservatism_L] and [MLW.neutral_Social_L] have denounced the move to abolish term limits and are both calling for an immediate special election, they claim if we do not give them what they ask for, they will call on the people of Malawi to depose us!"
 MLW_UDF.20.O5: "Let them try, we were voted in, we will serve our term!"
 MLW_UDF.20.O6: "Let's not be too hasty, how about we compromise?"
 MLW_UDF.20.O7: "Bakili Muluzi may have brought about the end of the UDF..."

 MLW_UDF.21.t1: "How To Deal With The Loophole"
 MLW_UDF.21.d1: "Whilst a loophole has been found, our legal experts and party officials are still unsure as to how to proceed, as some of the wording of the constitution currently allows us to completely strip term limits from the presidency, if we word the amendment ambiguously enough. Many in the UDF disagree with this choice and instead wish to allow Muluzi his requested third term at the maximum, how should we proceed?"
 MLW_UDF.21.t3: "The Referendum Passes!"
 MLW_UDF.21.d3: "Our fervent campaigning for the change, thinly veiled as \"clarifying and simplifying the legal code of Malawi\" has passed, and the people and courts seem more than happy for us to rewrite however we see fit. Thanks to our ambiguous wording of the referendum, we can either strip term limits from the presidency entirely, or only allow the changes that Muluzi desires, in the form of a third term."
 MLW_UDF.21.O4: "Ambiguous wording strikes again!"
 MLW_UDF.21.O5: "Three terms is plenty for Malawi."

 MLW_UDF.21.t2: "Who Will Be The Successor?"
 MLW_UDF.21.d2: "Whilst there was some within the UDF who wanted to allow Muluzi to run for a third (or more) term, it wasn't meant to be. Now we are faced with a tough choice; who will lead the UDF going forwards?\nCassim Chilumpha is a good choice, with a background in education, he may be what Malawi needs to deal with the population boom.\nAtupele Muluzi, the son of Bakili, who will more than likely lead much like his father, though some critics are hostile to this decision of hereditary leadership.\nBingu wa Mutharika, seemingly the favoured choice, a great economist who is sure to see Malawi set up for the upcoming millennia, should the UDF hold on to power."
 MLW_UDF.21.O1: "Chilumpha can teach us a thing or two!"
 MLW_UDF.21.O2: "Keep it in the family, they know best!"
 MLW_UDF.21.O3: "Bingu will keep everyone happy!"

 MLW_UDF.21.t4: "The Referendum Fails!"
 MLW_UDF.21.d4: "Despite our best efforts, and endless campaigning, it seems as if the people of Malawi have seen through our thinly veiled attempts at continuing the Muluzi reign through a constitutional change disguised as \"clarifying and simplifying the legal code of Malawi\", we will have to start to look at the party to see who may be the next best candidate, though we have lost a decent amount of support within the voter base, who see this referendum as an attempt to erode democracy."
 MLW_UDF.21.O6: "Well, shit."

 MLW_UDF.22.t1: "Cassim Chilumpha Takes His Place"
 MLW_UDF.22.d1: "Lawyer by trade and one of Malawi's chief legal experts, Cassim Chilumpha has served the UDF and Malawi diligently in various positions, from Minister of Defence to Minister of Finance. Most important to us in the upcoming millennia is his prior position of Minister for Education, where he saw our literacy rate skyrocket to where it is today."
 MLW_UDF.22.O1: "Let's hope he can keep it up!"

 MLW_UDF.22.t2: "Atupele Muluzi Takes His Place"

 MLW_UDF.3.d: "We currently have a decently sized private schooling system within Malawi, but some critics think that private schools entrench elitism and tend to breed an atmosphere of nepotism.

 # OIL
 MLW_oil.1.t: "To Drill, Or Not To Drill?"
 MLW_oil.1.d: "Ever since the first discovery of oil deposits in and around Lake Nyasa, Malawians have considered the route ahead regarding the actual use of the lake; whether to exploit this underutilised wealth of resources or to ignore it entirely and aim towards keeping the Malawian fishing sector afloat with keeping the waters clean and pollution free.\n\nIt is expected that we may agitate our neighbours who also stake claims over the region should we go ahead with drilling, but we simply cannot afford to be left behind in the millennium to come."
 MLW_oil.1.O1: "Now to make a decision..."
 MLW_oil.2.t: "Another Tough Choice"
 MLW_oil.2.d: "Our neighbours might not be happy with our decision to drill for oil, but maybe we can get someone else to drill for us? Simply offering a lucrative deal wherein our guests get a free ride in exchange for them providing us some of the oil they extract. They've even promised to share some of the dividends should it be a good year!\n\nSome of our citizens with more of a nationalist sentiment however have voiced concerns about letting a foreign power take our resources, it may be more expensive in the short term but at least we will have control over our own oilfields!"
 MLW_oil.2.O1: "They both make convincing arguments..."
 MLW_oil.20.t: "Who will be the lucky driller?"
 MLW_oil.20.d: "There are 4 contracts on your desk [MLW.GetLeader], all are offering roughly the same deal, with only slight differences, it does seem hard to pick from the bunch...\n\nSo, who is the lucky winner of the Nyasa Oilfield contract?"

 MLW_oil.4.d2: "Our economy has grown leaps and bounds since the early drilling expeditions achieved success, and scores of new sites are being touted as drilling sites.\n\nAlthough forming a national oil company was a risky gamble, it seems to have paid off in the long run, with our people enjoying one of the best standards of living in the region.

By achieving level 10 (X) in either §Gdiplomacy§! or §Rmilitarism§! within a state, we will be able to attempt to take control of the state, after the state falls into our control, we will need to work on §Ycoring§! the region."

 MLW_MCP_M_move_away_from_banda_desc: "The past is the past. We must move forwards as a nation and a party to ensure a future for our citizens. Hastings Kamuzu Banda was a stain on the MCP's history books, and whilst that chapter is long behind us, the people of Malawi, and Africa as a whole, will not forget so easily.\n\nThe next few weeks will lay a clear choice for the Malawian Congress Party; the same old Kamuzuist MCP, or a new path towards moderation."
