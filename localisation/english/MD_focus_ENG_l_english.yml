 # Moon Base Event
 ENG_moon.1.t: "Outpost on the Moon"
 ENG_moon.1.d: "Our scientists and engineers are ready to send astronauts and equipment to live semi-permanently on the Moon. A total sum of roughly 12 astronauts  will be sent there, along with tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment, supplies, living spaces, and personal items. This outpost will need to be  regularly moved as the Lunar day lasts 29 Earth days, which is far too long for batteries to keep stored power on the Moon.\n\nThe base itself will be on the  poles, easily moveable, to get the maximum usage of our solar panels. Additionally, experiments will be carried out to determine long-term living conditions on  the Moon. Extraction of lunar ice could not only lead to liquid water for plants and food for astronauts on the Moon, but also lead to separating it into oxygen  and hydrogen, rocket fuel.\n\nThis may take months or years to get the research needed to do this. Within this time, however, using the funds for this project,  we will build a depot orbiting the Moon to allow easier access to the Moon, and refueling to get to Earth.\n\nAll of this is achievable within the next decade.  Now, however, is the time to launch."
 ENG_moon.1.a: "Launch!"
 ENG_moon.2.t: "Moonbase Alpha"
 ENG_moon.2.d: "Our scientists and engineers have officially landed on the Moon, and are currently in the process of setting up the Moon-base. Each section is  divided into \"modules,\" not quite buildings on their own, but not together as one. There is a habitation module, for rest, food module, for growing food, lab  module, which is the largest with most of the scientific equipment, a maintenance module, containing all the maintenance tools to repair things if they get  broken, an amenities module, since these people are here for 6 months, and working all day everyday isn't good for the mind, and quite a few solar panels. \n\nFood deliveries will be common for these first months as it takes time to grow food. Water and oxygen will be obtained through the Lunar ice. Lastly, these  scientists will stay until shortly after moving to the next location in roughly 6 months time when the solar panels become defunct due to the Lunar day and night  where the outpost is located lasts 6 months.\n\nMoonbase Alpha is complete."
 ENG_moon.2.a: "Science!"
 ENG_moon.3.t: "Colony Progresses"
 ENG_moon.3.d: "Our scientific outpost on the Moon has had a major breakthrough. With expansion of their current solar panel network, and recent discoveries  making separating water to make oxygen and hydrogen easier, they have been able to come up with enough oxygen and hydrogen to fully fuel the most recent supply  rocket. This is such a necessary breakthrough which will allow the Moon itself, given enough time and investment, can become a hub for future space ventures into  outer space.\n\nSpace itself is getting smaller."
 ENG_moon.3.a: "We're good at being pioneers"
 ENG_moon.4.t: "Crisis on the Moon"
 ENG_moon.4.d: "Drastic measures need to be taken place immediately. For reasons currently unknown, the habitation module has ruptured and \"exploded.\"\n\nAn  hour ago, all 12 scientists were doing their duties when, all of a sudden, there was a massive rupture in the habitation module.\n\nSince waves don't travel in a  vacuum, most didn't realize until they physically saw what had happened.\n\nThere is an emergency fund as part of the budget, so there is no need to allocate  more funds to the project, and the scientists can always sleep in the other isolated modules; however, this has spooked many, stating that a few, many, or even  all of our scientists could have died, and has also lowered the morale of the scientists since they could have died. Thus, attempting to continue the outpost on  the Moon will be politically costly, and a rotation of scientists may need to happen now rather than later, due to the sapping of morale.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 ENG_moon.4.a: "Send emergency aid!"
 ENG_moon.4.b: "Abandon the project. It's not meant for us"
 ENG_moon.5.t: "Colony Progresses Further"
 ENG_moon.5.d: "Our Moon outpost has made another major breakthrough. They have managed to ship Hydrogen 3, a gas which seems perfect for fusion, to Earth, and  scientists at home have figured out how to conduct fusion with it! Not only this, but the power generated from this fusion is near the amount used to do the  reaction in the first place. This means that, with some improvements, this could result in successful fusion power! Not only does this allow immense benefits at  home, along with knowledge we may be able to use in using other materials for fusion, we can use this on the Moon, allowing a permanent outpost rather than  mobile outposts!\n\nAll of this is far ahead of schedule, which is a surprise, and many at UKSC have been left unprepared to implement this into the current  Moonbase. So, a new Moonbase is needed, in a much better spot for rapid expansion than the current location of Moonbase Alpha. It's time to start preparations on  Moonbase Beta."
 ENG_moon.5.a: "Life continues on"
 ENG_moon.6.t: "Another Crisis on the Moon"
 ENG_moon.6.d: "More drastic measures need to be taken now. Two more modules have ruptured. This time, it's both the Food and Amenities modules.\n\nRoughly forty  minutes ago, a scientist was about to enter the Food module when it suddenly exploded. The scientist is fine, and no-one but the plants were harmed. However, it  was adjacent to the Amenities module, and it caused it to rupture and explode. Again, no-one was hurt.\n\nThis new occurrence, however, has raised the hairs of  many back home, questioning the safety of the modules. After the previous explosion, UKSC replaced the modules, ensuring that they wouldn't explode, but it seems  like prolonged pressure can cause something to break much more easily than it would otherwise. UKSC has already quickly responded, ordering new modules be made  immediately, as well as a close inspection of all current modules (As you can't \"recall\" modules from the Moon as of this moment).\n\nWith mounting pressure at  home to stop going forward with the project until all safety concerns are resolved, the continuation of the Moonbase program comes into question. In addition to  the political pushback, the emergency fund has been cut in half, so UKSC is requesting another $5 billion to sort out future concerns. It remains your choice to  decide whether to continue."
 ENG_moon.6.a: "Send more emergency aid!"
 ENG_moon.6.b: "We can't continue doing things like this"
 ENG_moon.7.t: "Moonbase Beta"
 ENG_moon.7.d: "At this point, our scientists and engineers on the Moon need to move to another location on the poles. The costs for doing this are already  established in the long-term budget, so we don't need to add any new funding to the project yet.\n\nWith this new moonbase, we will be able to use new  discoveries we have uncovered to allow the base to be established permanently, unlike our previous moonbase. With the use of better rockets, better power  generation, better ice extraction and separation, we can use this new base, at a site more suited for rapid expansion, to facilitate colonization efforts of the  Moon. This is not the only good news, entrepreneurs and corporations are flooding to UKSC en-mass for requests to put their newly developed mining systems on the  Moon. Even other space programs in other countries are now extremely interested in starting up scientific and mining outposts on the Moon, however, due to your  diligent efforts, we not only have a massive head start, but we are the only country actively attempting to colonize the Moon.\n\nThe future on our Moon is  bright and Chinese."

 ENG_mars.1.t: "Mars Rover Mission"
 ENG_mars.1.d: "Our scientists and engineers are ready to send our Rover to the mars. It has a total sum of roughly 14 sensors installed, along with tens of  millions of dollars worth of equipment. This Rover will need to be regularly moved as the Mars day lasts 1 1/5 Earth days, which is far too long for batteries to  keep stored power on the Mars.\n\nThe Rover itself will be on the poles, easily moveable, to get the maximum usage of our solar panels. Additionally, experiments  will be carried out to determine long-term living conditions on the Mars. Extraction of ice could not only lead to liquid water for plants and food for future  astronauts on the Mars, but also lead to separating it into oxygen and hydrogen, rocket fuel.\n\nThis may take months or years to get the research needed to do  this.

 ENG_mars.2.t: "Mars Colony Project"
 ENG_mars.2.d: "If humans want to colonize Mars, they must establish a permanent base that is self-sustaining. This is the dream of countless space explorers and  the only way for humans to set foot in the space. All this will become a reality today."
 ENG_mars.2.a: "Mars here we come!"
 ENG_mars.3.t: "Landing System failure"
 ENG_mars.3.d: "After a journey of nearly 60 million kilometers, our spacecraft finally appeared over Mars. The iron oxide all over Mars showed a red appearance.  The planet, long visible only through a lens, is now within sight. \nThe spacecraft enters landing mode. The captain, who had practiced countless times on the  simulator, issued the order, but there seemed to be a problem with the landing device. At this time, large beads of sweat instantly covered the captain's  forehead."
 ENG_mars.3.a: "London, we've had a problem."
 ENG_mars.4.t: "Vehicle Failure"
 ENG_mars.4.d: "After a thrilling half hour, the spacecraft finally escaped the risk of crashing and landed crookedly on the Mars Utopia Plain. This is also the  landing site of the previous Beagle rover. It is recognized as the largest impact basin on Mars and the solar system, with an estimated diameter of 3,300  kilometers. \nAfter landing, the crew will transfer to a special rover and head to the southern part of the plain to establish a base, but the vibrations from  the previous landing of the spacecraft seem to have had some impact on the rover. It is clear that situation has developed not necessarily to crew's advantage"
 ENG_mars.4.a: "There seems to be something wrong with our bloody vehicle today."
 ENG_mars.5.t: "Arrival at Base"
 ENG_mars.5.d: "40 kilometers, the first time humans have traveled such a long march on a planet other than Earth. Such an ordinary distance on earth is a  breakthrough in the history of human spaceflight. \nAfter going through the tense process of setting up camp, transmitting all necessary data back to the earth,  and checking the parameters of all equipment, the captain who was sitting on the bed could finally take a drink of tea. \nThrough the window of transparent  synthetic material above the head, a light point among the stars shone with a little blue light, and that was the Earth. \n\n'Better.' the captain muttered."
 ENG_mars.5.a: "Don’t be afraid of being late for a good meal."
 ENG_mars.6.t: "Successful Landing"
 ENG_mars.6.d: "Everything was perfect, as expected, the spacecraft landed at the designated landing site exactly, and the human journey to Mars began in peace.  \n"
 ENG_mars.6.a: "I knew our crew would be able to complete the mission."
 ENG_mars.7.t: "Arrival at Base"
 ENG_mars.7.d: "The landing point of the spacecraft was the preset address of the base, and the crew began to camp on the spot to prepare for the construction of  mankind's first permanent base on Mars. No one noticed that the space boots left countless messy footprints on the Martian soil."
 ENG_mars.7.a: "One small step for Mars, one giant leap for mankind."
 ENG_mars.8.t: "Locate Water Source"
 ENG_mars.8.d: "Water is an essential resource for human survival. One of the main purposes of previous Mars exploration activities was to find water sources on  Mars. Although there are no surface lakes or rivers like Earth, Mars' water resources basically exist in the form of ice under the surface of Mars. \nHowever,  the actual precise positioning requires someone to conduct on-site surveys in person."
 ENG_mars.8.a: "We can't survive without our tea!"
 ENG_mars.9.t: "Underground Radiation Protection"
 ENG_mars.9.d: "Due to the thin atmosphere of Mars and the lack of a planetary magnetic field, radiation from space reaches the surface unimpeded. The base could  not provide enough shelter when it was first built, so digging a nest in the ground became the first choice to avoid radiation. \nWitnessing the pride to create  a new base for the United Kingdom, Reminded the crew of the great days of the British Empire."
 ENG_mars.9.a: "Britannia Rules the Space"
 ENG_mars.10.t: "The First Harvest on Mars"
 ENG_mars.10.d: "The problem of water sources has been solved, and the energy source is temporarily provided by solar power. Therefore, the production of food  (and Tea) on Mars has become the most important matter at present. \nTraditional cereal crops have been excluded due to their growth cycles and harvesting  processes, and potatoes have become the first human crops to be grown on Mars. Although Mars is not as bright as Earth due to the distance from the sun, the  potatoes in the greenhouse seem to grow more lushly. Humanity's first harvest on Mars is in sight."
 ENG_mars.10.a: "All nature, organic, Martian-grown potatoes."
 ENG_mars.11.t: "Sandstorm"
 ENG_mars.11.d: "Sandstorm are a common occurrence on Mars. Although the air pressure on Mars is much lower than that of the Earth, the Martian storm is not as  devastating as the previous legends, just like in that movie. \nHowever, the raised dust still poses a lot of hidden dangers to human bases, especially since  solar energy is an indispensable energy source for current bases."
 ENG_mars.11.a: "We have no chance to save Matt Damon here."
 ENG_mars.12.t: "Accident"
 ENG_mars.12.d: "To go up the mountain often and eventually run into a tiger. The Martian dust storm lasted far longer than previously expected, and the battery  life inside the base seemed to be in a very pessimistic situation. \nIn order to continue the Mars colony mission, we need to make a decision, choose to evacuate  and find a new location, or continue to repair the damaged facilities."
 ENG_mars.12.a: "Evacuate"
 ENG_mars.12.b: "Fix Base"
 ENG_mars.13.t: "Evacuate"
 ENG_mars.13.d: "We can't wait any longer. The situation is now very critical and it's time to use backup rockets for evacuation. After checking that all the team  members had safely boarded the ship, the captain reluctantly looked back at the base building that was still in building. He suppressed the grief in his heart  and gave the order to the artificial intelligence guide to launch the spacecraft. \n'We will be back!' As a huge burst of smoke rose, the spacecraft broke away  from the Martian ground and slowly rose into the sky."
 ENG_mars.13.a: "Where there is life, there is hope."
 ENG_mars.14.t: "Repair Damaged Base"
 ENG_mars.14.d: "We cannot sit back and wait, we must start repairs on the base immediately with any cost, otherwise all the gains we have made on Mars will be  ruined, and no one can survive in this chaos. Saving the base means saving ourselves."
 ENG_mars.14.a: "For the sake of sacrifice and great ambition, we dare to make a new world."
 ENG_mars.15.t: "Mars City Project"
 ENG_mars.15.d: "We have made outstanding achievements in building a Mars colony. But there is still some distance to go before we can finally achieve our goal.  Do we still want to continue investing in Mars construction?"
 ENG_mars.15.a: "Upgrade"
 ENG_mars.15.b: "Don´t need it"
 ENG_mars.16.t: "Yes"
 ENG_mars.16.d: "As long as we take one more step forward, our mission on Mars will be completely completed. There is no half-measures in our agenda."
 ENG_mars.16.a: "Don't pass the responsibility to the next generation."
 ENG_mars.17.t: "No"
 ENG_mars.17.d: "The current Mars base is complete enough, and it is unwise to continue to invest more. We still have many problems to face on earth, and it is  impossible to just throw money into space."
 ENG_mars.17.a: "Believe in the wisdom of future generations."
 ENG_mars.18.t: "Mars City completed"
 ENG_mars.18.d: "After our unremitting efforts, our colony on Mars has finally been completed. Human beings will never forget these efforts, and one day human  beings will set foot on the entire galaxy."
 ENG_mars.18.a: "Our journey is the whole galaxy."
 ENG_mars.19.t: "Established New Sub-base"
 ENG_mars.19.d: "As more spacecraft brought more personnel and materials, the originally Mars base began to prosper. The water resources under the original base  can no longer carry more people, and it is urgent to establish a new sub-base. \nAs the spacecraft of the first team gradually disappeared from sight, the former  captain and today the mayor of first new Beijing city recalled the past when the Mars rover fell into a trench."
 ENG_mars.19.a: "Mom, I’m going on a long voyage today."
 ENG_mars.20.t: "Mars City Monument"
 ENG_mars.20.d: "As humans have traveled across Mars, Mars has become the new home for humans on Earth. The terraforming of Mars is proceeding in an orderly  manner. At the first landing point of the human spacecraft, a huge monument was built to commemorate the men and women who sacrificed their lives during the  journey and construction in the process of conquering Mars. They will forever be engraved in the journey of human civilization."
 ENG_mars.20.a: "For the mankind!"
 ENG_mars_city_building_completed: "Mars city building completed"
 #Asteroid Mining Event Chain
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.8.t: "Launching the Asteroid Mining Initiative"
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.8.d: "Asteroid Mining has been a fantasy for many before us. Asteroids themselves carry much wanted platinum group metals, gold, silver, and  iron group metals. It could become extremely lucrative for any spacefaring country. So today, the establishment of an British Royal Asteroid Mining Company, or  BRAMC, will provide the first step towards mining asteroids. Using vast telescope arrays across the Empire, we can look for suitable asteroids in nearby outer  space, then pull it into orbit and mine it. Spotting a suitable asteroid will be difficult, as, relative to the distance they are at, they are quite small.  Luckily, there's actually quite a few which pass by Earth every so often, so it wouldn't take long to get one to stay in Earth's orbit."
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.8.a: "Just need to wait for an asteroid..."
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.9.t: "Asteroid Spotted"
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.9.d: "Recently, our scientists at BRAMC spotted a suitable asteroid passing near Earth. This has been a relief for the BRAMC, as some doubted  if we'd actually ever spot a suitable, economical asteroid at all. However, this asteroid is moving slowly enough, is large enough, and is rich enough to be  moved into orbit and mined. The asteroid is, in-fact, larger than Wales. The next step is simply to move this asteroid into orbit around Earth, which has never  been done before. In the meantime, British Space Command Engineers, and even private enterprises like Virgin Galactic, have invented mechanisms to mine the  asteroid, so they will be ready by the time the asteroid gets into orbit."
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.9.a: "Let's get that baby into orbit"
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.10.t: "Asteroid in Orbit"
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.10.d: "With the asteroid in orbit, UKSC and Virgin are both sending missions to the orbiting asteroid. UKSC is mainly concerned about  collecting scientific data, while Virgin Galactic is more concerned about mining the material. No doubt this is a noteworthy achievement, which gives us an edge  in space. There is even talk about bringing in more asteroids, but many say that additional asteroids can come later, as this asteroid is very large and well  suited for mining. Other countries are already looking at us with envy, and are considering their own asteroid mining programs. The costs are extremely high even  to develop the technology to even get there, so there is little worry among Virgin Galactic or UKSC that competition will arive."
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.10.a: "Mining shall begin"
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.11.t: "Profits from Mining Start Pouring in"
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.11.d: "After establishing mining operations, Virgin_Galactic and UKSC have both sent back their first shipments of space-material to labs and  markets around the globe. The world has jelously looked on us, and there have been open talks in their respective chambers of legislation about opening their own  asteroid mining operations. While we soon may get competition, we can enjoy the monopoly for now."
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.11.a: "I'm Chuffed To Bits!"
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.12.t: "Profits from Asteroid Mining"
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.12.d: "The latest shipments from our asteroid mining operations have come in, and have generated many revenues. These shipments include  platinum, gold, and silver. Putting the revenues to good use would be wise."
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.12.a: "Excellent!"
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.13.t: "Potential for Asteroid Mining"
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.13.d: "Recently, The House of Commons has allowed UKSC and Virgin Galactic, a private space company, to bring a fairly large asteroid into  orbit of Earth and mine it. Our advisors recommend we invest in this new space, as it could allow rare materials to be delivered straight to our country. Some,  however, have cited the massive bill the United Kingdom had to pay to even start the operations, and oppose expanding into space. The return for this investment  depends, but it may take 25 years to just break even. More substantial investment can bring this down, but we'll be far behind the rest for quite a while. \n\nWhat shall we do in regards to Asteroid Mining? Start a national program, or ignore it altogether?"
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.13.a: "Invest in Asteroid Mining"
 ENG_Asteroid_Mining.13.b: "Too expensive and a waste of our time!"

 Mobile_Fires_Platorm_Program.1.d: "Following the end of the Cold War and anticipation of a conflict on the German Plains dulled, the Army's stock of 155mm  artillery systems declined, and now, with new threats on the horizon, the MOD has decided to take the steps to resurrect this capability. Numerous programs and  partners to fulfil this contract have come forward, of which only one will be successful."
