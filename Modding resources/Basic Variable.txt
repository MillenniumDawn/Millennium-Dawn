#Birdy's Basic with Variables

There are a ton interesting and fun things you can accomplish using simple variables and other forms of variables that arent entirely possible using only in-game values. Variables open up a whole new world in terms of gameplay and design that is normally undervalued in a game that its primary focus is the military aspect. 

#Basic Commands for Variables 
#set_variable = { var = example value = 1 } - Sets the Variable (can be used anywhere executing a script) to a value and also sets a variable with a name. Creates the variable if it doesnt exist before, OR sets it to a new value if already present somewhere.
#add_to_variable { var = example value = 1 } - this is the long way of adding to a variable but it just adds one so now the variable is valued at 2.
#subtract_from_variable { var = example value = 2 } - subtracts yields 0 from the current running script. 

You can also multiple, divide, round, and a few other functions depending on the situation you are using the variables. 

##Basic Setting Exampl:
Example:
	####American Economic Variables Pre-Set###
	###Regulatory Variable 
	set_variable = { var = USA_economic_regulation_var value = 45 }
	set_variable = { var = USA_economic_regulation_var max = 100 }
	set_variable = { var = USA_economic_regulation_var min = 0 }
	###Strength of Wall Street 
	set_variable = { var = USA_strength_of_wall_street_var value = 17 }
	set_variable = { var = USA_strength_of_wall_street_var max = 50 }
	set_variable = { var = USA_strength_of_wall_street_var min = 0 }
	
The variables here are set in the United States history file and used for the American Economy decisions and effects that occur with every one of the American economy focuses, events or decisions. There are two new topics here in the set_variable which is min and max. They simply set the max possible value and the minimum possible value for the given variable. 

This is a basic rundown of variables and the simplest way to begin and use them. There are many ways of using this flexible effects in both systems and in general effects.
