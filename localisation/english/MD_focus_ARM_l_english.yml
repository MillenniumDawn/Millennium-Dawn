 arme.1000.d: "After the end of the Artsakh War, Armenia found itself in a very grave condition. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent rule of Levon Ter-Petrosyan led the country to chaos and the rise of banditry. The shooting of the Armenian parliament in 1999 by dissidents, behind whom were unknown forces, only added fuel to the fire of the fragmented public and government. After the relative stabilization of society, well-known both in the military-political and in the criminal circles, President Robert Kocharian became a key figure in keeping the current order in which the opposition parties are gaining momentum more and more and want to lead Armenia in their own way, as it seems to them, the right path. The communists, who have great support among the people after the fall of Soviet power, shocked by the execution of their leader Karen Demirchyan, are ready to close their eyes to all the prerequisites for a bad alliance and unite with pro-Western and small parties in order to take revenge and return the socialist system to Armenia. At the same time, the pro-Western parties, represented by the first President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan, are preparing new rallies in order to declare themselves as a significant political force that must be reckoned with and which, on occasion, will lead the people, even if for they will have to unite with the nationalist Zhirayr Sefilian or with the communists. The weakest force in the opposition is the disorganized small parties that lack clear leadership, but with the right political knack, even they can take over in this Russian-backed house of cards. At the moment, Kocharian has many political problems, but using his connections in the army, oligarchy and foreign diplomacy, he needs to make a responsible decision."

The planned development of the national economy is the greatest advantage of socialism over capitalism. Life has confirmed the statements of the founders of Marxism that the conditions for a planned economy are created by the victory of the proletarian revolution and the transfer of the means of production to public ownership.

ARM_army: "The Army in A New Era"
ARM_army_desc: "After the end of the Artsakh War, the Armenian army, which had shown itself, experienced a significant decline, which began even after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Thanks to the Soviet legacy, as well as a large-scale militia, the Armenians managed to defeat Azerbaijan and establish a precarious balance in the region. Old doctrines, as well as outdated weapons, ossified generals and economic problems put an end to the development of the armed forces. The main way of development is the continuation of cooperation with Russia, as well as with other neighbors and partners in the CSTO. However, some military experts insist on a complete overhaul of the military doctrine and structure of the army along the Western lines. Armenia, being in a diplomatically advantageous position, can try to take the best from each side, or take a clear course of cooperation with certain forces. Even without significant resources, Armenia has great potential if it can correctly distribute its priorities."
