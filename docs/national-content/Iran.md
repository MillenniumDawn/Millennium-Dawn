## Unique National Features

### Ban on Parties Other than the Two Factions
Reflecting Iran’s real political system, any political parties other than the Reformists and the Followers of Principle are banned.
To lift this ban, you must overthrow the government using the Balance of Power system described below.

Some national focus trees are available only when either the Reformists or the Followers of Principle are in power, while some others are available only when neither faction holds power. In addition, if you manage to lift the party ban, you will gain access to party-specific focus trees and leader-specific focus trees.

### Balance of Power System

Iran features the Balance of Power system.
Raising the Legitimacy of the Islamic Republic or moving toward The Thousand Year Government (shifting to the right) will increase support for the Emerging Outlook, thereby strengthening the current political system.
Conversely, lowering the Legitimacy of the Islamic Republic or moving toward Collapse of the Islamic Republic (shifting to the left) will reduce support for the Emerging Outlook.
Once the Collapse of the Islamic Republic side reaches more than 90%, the event "The Breaking Point" will trigger, starting the revolution event chain.

There are several ways to shift the Balance of Power value:

* Taking national focuses that increase or decrease the value (can be filtered in the focus tree)

* Choosing certain options in events

* Executing decisions within the Balance of Power system

Additionally, in July 2000, the first protest event will occur.
By choosing the option that triggers Nationwide Protests, the nationwide protest mechanic will begin.
In this event chain, each time protests spread to a new state, the Balance of Power will shift toward Collapse of the Islamic Republic.

Therefore:

* If you want to change the initial political system, intentionally choose the Nationwide Protests option.

* If you want to maintain the initial system, avoid choosing it.

Note: If The Breaking Point is triggered while the protest event chain is active, the protests will subside, but the revolution event chain will still begin without any issues, so you can continue playing without concern.

###　マジュレス
イランの議会。一定期間ごとに選挙と討論が行われる。討論とは討論が終了すると、議会の政党からミッションを受けることができ、そのミッションを達成すれば褒美が、失敗すればペナルティがあるという要素。

討論でもらえるミッションの例
ミッション　4つの特定州のネットワークインフラが2以上
達成報酬　オフィス街+2、火力発電所+1（国庫の金は消費する）
失敗時　オフィス街-2

### Nuclear Development Tree
This tree contains many national focuses (NFs) related to nuclear development, but also includes general buffs. Therefore, it's worth checking even if you don’t intend to pursue nuclear development.
In the mid-section, the focus "Natanz Enrichment Complex" provides access to the Civilian R&D Facility, which is required for nuclear research.
The initial branch splits into two paths:

* The left path boosts domestic nuclear production.

* The right path involves trading nuclear technology or missiles with eastern countries that already possess nuclear weapons.

After "Natanz Enrichment Complex",

* The left path reveals Iran’s nuclear program to the U.S., halts nuclear and missile development, and aims to lift sanctions in return.

* The right path cannot proceed unless nuclear development is already underway.

The tree extending downward from the center focuses on various Iranian institutions and offers national spirits that provide buffs corresponding to each institution.

### Economic Tree

#### Domestic-Oriented Path

#### International Path

イランの経済ツリーはいきなり択一式のルート選択から始まる。「Third Development Plan」から始まるツリーは国内各地の発展を重視したツリーで、インフラを始めとした各建設物や資源をバランスよくもらえるルートになっている。対して「Embracing the Open Market」から始まるツリーはより国際市場との結びつきを重視するツリーで各国のエネルギー企業との協力する方針などが含まれる。こちらも多くの施設を獲得できるが、より化石燃料にフォーカスした内容になっている。
中央の共通ツリーは経済の直接的な発展というとりも国家として腐敗との戦いや影響力の大きな団体との関係、教育制度のあり方を決定するツリーだ。腐敗などいくつかのデバフを軽減することができるNFも多い。

### 軍事ツリー

### 改革派・原理主義派ツリー

## Q&A

### How to remove "U.S. Sanctions"?
The U.S. must execute a decision to lift the sanctions.
To make the AI-controlled United States lift sanctions, you can either raise the U.S. opinion of Iran to over 20 or abandon nuclear development.
You can abandon nuclear development through the national focus “IAEA Autonomy.”
The preceding national focus, “The Grand Bargain,” will result in Iran revealing its nuclear program, but if the conditions described in that focus’s description are met at that time, you can use the nuclear program as leverage to secure aid from the United States.

### How to increase U.S. opinion?
* By executing the decision "Send Diplomats to the West" from the Iranian president’s decision menu, the negative opinion modifier from the U.S. can be removed.
This decision, which can only be used when a Reformist is president, has a 250-day cooldown but can be used repeatedly.
Using it twice will remove two negative opinion modifiers from the United States.
Additionally, completing the national focus “The Grand Bargain” will also allow you to remove the “No Diplomatic Ties” opinion modifier.
* By triggering a revolution through the Balance of Power system and overthrowing the initial political regime, you can remove all negative opinion modifiers from the United States (except for “Different Outlook”).
* Improving relations is also an option, but be aware that if "U.S. Sanctions" have not been removed, the political power cost for improving relations is increased by 1.5 times.
