 iraqi_events.1.d: "As the year 2000 dawns upon Iraq, the nation finds itself grappling with a host of formidable challenges that threaten its stability and progress. Iraq continues to grapple with the suffocating impact of international sanctions imposed following the Gulf War. These sanctions have severely hampered the country's ability to rebuild its infrastructure, revive its economy, and provide essential services to its citizens. The restrictions on trade and financial transactions have resulted in a stagnant economy, high unemployment rates, and widespread poverty. The scarcity of resources and limited access to vital technologies further exacerbate Iraq's struggles. Furthermore, Iraq's political isolation persists as suspicions linger among the international community regarding the government's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and its alleged human rights abuses. This isolation hampers Iraq's ability to establish fruitful diplomatic relations, engage in mutually beneficial partnerships, and regain its rightful place in the global stage. Internally, Iraq faces deep-seated social discontent arising from the mismanagement of resources, systemic corruption, and inadequate public services. These issues have led to public frustration, deteriorating trust in the government, and a growing sense of disillusionment among the population. Addressing these grievances is crucial for fostering social cohesion and ensuring the well-being of the Iraqi people."

 iraq_md.304.d: "For several days, Saddam had been complaining about the lack of Chocolate in the palace. Because of this, his assistants could not put up with his complaining for much longer, and eventually just took him to the store as he insisted he wanted to personally pick out the brand of chocolate himself. As the guards and assistants were distracted by the crowd forming outside, one of them noticed that Saddam was trying to whisper into the ear of the clerk, and overheard him saying \"Listen, if you ensure that our ships flow through Hormuz without problem, and you go back on your deal with the Omani's and Iranian's, then I will give you a very favorable price for any future oil deals\". The Guards then swiftly bought the chocolate, and escorted Saddam back to the palace."

He went on to describe how he felt sorry for tainting a local towns water supply with apple-cider vinegar. A nosey maid came across this letter, and reported it to one of Saddam's close assistants, who immedietaly went on to have a talk with Saddam about how he did not commit such a crime. Saddam insisted that he did, and that he could no longer stand the guilt. The assistant then reluctantly brought a nutrionist to inform Saddam about the health benefits of apple-cider vinegar, and how instead he helped the locals rather than harm. Saddam then secretly wrote and published a patriotic letter pleading with everyone to drink apple-cider vinegar so that Iraq may have \"The Earths Finest Soldiers\"."

This resulted in the guests being interrogated by the guards stationed in the palace upon their arrival, causing a commotion that could have been totally avoided had Saddam just informed others of his plans. The guests were eventually let in, forgetting that he invited the guests in the first place, Saddam had not prepared any food for the guests, so they were presented with cold, leftover food that he frantically took from the kitchen."

 iraq_md.308.d: "For hours, Saddam's care-givers had not seen him leave his room, as they believed he was rehearsing a quick speech that he had planned for later that day. Out of concern, they began trying to listen to what he was saying and one of them recognized the speech as his previous one about the American invasion. An assistant was later told to enter the room to inform Saddam that he had already given the speech years ago, and he did so with fear and reluctance. Saddam then furiously threw the papers against the wall and told the assistant to get out. Later that day the sounds of a crying Saddam could be heard the palace."

During the flight, Saddam insisted that he knew the way to France as he in his own words, \"had been to France many times\".

 iraq_md.313.d: "This morning, Saddam was being driven to an official's office for a meeting that they had arranged. On his way there, he saw a street being blocked off for a planned parade being held there, which he mistook for a military parade. He than told his driver to pull over, and Saddam rushed to the podium on the side of the street, kicking the announcer off the stage. He then began saluting in anticipation for the soldiers, but instead he was caught saluting cartoon characters as he swiftly realized that he was at a childrens parade."
 iraq_md.313.a: "Shit"

 iraq_md.314.d: "Fearing an imminent nuclear strike from the United States, Saddam had ordered the construction of 500 new bunkers to be built across Iraq. This was because he believed that Iraq was still at a state of war with the United States, and therefore he panicked. The orders were cancelled, but the construction companies still lost money and thus they must be justly compensated."

 iraq_md.315.t: "Saddam Orders the Placement of Hundreds of Landmines in the Kurdistan Region to Combat Insurgents!"
 iraq_md.315.d: "Without consulting his military advisors, Saddam ordered the placement of hundreds of mines at the Kurdistan border in order to combat local insurgent groups.

But now top advisors to Saddam are warning that the mines could lead to some serious harm for our own troops."
 iraq_md.315.a: "Uh oh"
 iraq_md.316.t: "Saddam Hussein is Killed by a Landmine"
 iraq_md.316.d: "A few months back, Saddam Hussein decided that he wants to place hundreds of landmines near the Kurdish border in order to prevent attacks from local insurgents. Feeling that he is disliked by the Kurdish people, Saddam felt compelled to visit the region alone and meet locals as a show of good faith. Saddam then took a car from the palace, and began driving for hours to the Kurdistan border. There was just enough fuel in the car to get him to the border, and as the car ran low on gas, Saddam began moving on foot. Forgetting about the mines, somewhere on the way, Saddam stepped on a land mine and died on the spot."
