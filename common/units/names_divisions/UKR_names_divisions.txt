# All non-National Guard brigades are just the current ones.
# Worth noting is that almost all of the Air-Assault and one of two mountain brigades are actually mechanized today.
# As such, they fall where they do.

# As for National guard brigades, it turns out they are called a large variance of names, mixing 'Operational Brigade' with the one I used.
# As for now, I used 'Independent National Guard Brigade', but this is merely because some of the finer details are unknown and for uniformity.
