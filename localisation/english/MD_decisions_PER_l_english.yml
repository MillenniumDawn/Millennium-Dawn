 PER_resistance_economy_8: "Secure Strategic Goods"
 PER_resistance_economy_8_desc: "Our military has long required mass imports of weaponry, such as the Russian S-300 SAM, as our fledgeling military-complexes have not has the necessary resources to produce these on our own. However, due to the sanctions, we are not allowed to import weaponry, and our military is becoming underequiped as older models breakdown. This requires government intervention in the form of state owned military-complexes dedicated to the production of what we are lacking in, and we will need to make our own models of SAMs, rather than relying on imports and licenses."
