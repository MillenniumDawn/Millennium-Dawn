 shia_resistance_01_desc:0 "While elements within our Shi'a population occasionally express resentment towards our government, the majority of our country's Shi'a have no issue with our rule."
 shia_resistance_02:0 "Shi'a Resistance - Low"
 shia_resistance_02_desc:0 "Some radicals amongst the Shi'a population have called for the toppling of our government, but their calls have largely fallen on deaf ears. This is due to the relative lack of mistreatment by our government towards the Shi'a population."
 shia_resistance_03:0 "Shi'a Resistance - Moderate"
 shia_resistance_03_desc:0 "Anti-establishment Shi'a forces have gained some traction amongst the Shi'a population of our country due to some remaining barriers and difficulties faced by the Shi'a in our society. Opposition to violence, however, is still the most common position among the Shi'a."
 shia_resistance_04:0 "Shi'a Resistance - Substantial"
 shia_resistance_04_desc:0 "The unequal position of our Shi'a population relative to their Sunni counterparts has led to notable opposition to our government in certain quarters. While there is some militant activity against our government, this has so far remained relatively marginal."
 shia_resistance_05:0 "Shi'a Resistance - High"
 shia_resistance_05_desc:0 "Discrimination against the Shi'a has led to significant levels of openly-expressed resentment towards our government. Even more concerning is the increased support for militant Shi'a groups that advocate the removal of our government through violent means."
 shia_resistance_06:0 "Shi'a Resistance - Extremely High"
 shia_resistance_06_desc:0 "Our policies have substantially increased Shi'a hostility to our rule, increasing support for Shi'a militant groups that advocate the use of force against our government. However, the capabilities of these militant groups remain relatively small and they have only been able to conduct small occasional attacks."
 shia_resistance_07:0 "Shi'a Resistance - Severe"
 shia_resistance_07_desc:0 "Our attitude towards the Shi'a has inflamed anti-government perceptions among the vast majority of the Shi'a population. While many among the Shi'a population have not yet started advocating violence, the widespread hatred of our government has contributed to broad support for the use of violence to overthrow our government."
 shia_resistance_08:0 "Shi'a Resistance - Extremely Severe"
 shia_resistance_08_desc:0 "Our anti-Shi'a policies have led to overwhelming Shi'a opposition to our rule. While not all of this opposition has translated into open support for armed militant groups, most of the Shi'a population tacitly accept the use of violent tactics, emboldening Shi'a militant groups that have begun to launch more daring attacks."
 shia_resistance_09:0 "Shi'a Resistance - Critical"
 shia_resistance_09_desc:0 "Widespread hatred towards our government for its anti-Shi'a policies has led to widespread support for armed militancy among the Shi'a population. This support has emboldened Shi'a militant groups and allowed them to launch major attacks."

 shia_resistance_10_desc:0 "Near-universal hatred towards our government has led to overwhelming support for armed resistance against our government. Shi'a militant groups are flushed with funding and recruits and are therefore able to carry out large, well-coordinated operations."

 birthplace_of_wahhabism_desc:0 "The nation of Saudi Arabia was established as a result of an alliance between the military might of Ibn Saud and the radical religious vision of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. The movement that the latter founded, Wahhabism, sets itself apart from other Islamic doctrines in its ardent commitment to purifying Islam and returning the faith to its earliest and most authentic form. The form of Wahhabism espoused by Saudi Arabia emphasizes respect for religious authorities and government, unlike the more revolutionary and populist brands of salafism influenced by the thought of Sayyid Qutb which most jihadist groups have adopted."
 little_sparta:0 "Little Sparta"
 little_sparta_desc:0 "The UAE has historically punched above its weight on the international stage, sending its military forces to take part in multilateral military operations in farflung corners of the globe. The country has forged close ties with its powerful neighbor, Saudi Arabia, along with the West. By balancing the two against each other, the small country affectionately named by US officials as "Little Sparta" has been able to effectively maintain its own freedom of maneuvre."

 home_of_the_baharna_desc:0 "The majority of the Bahraini population are Shi'a Arabs who perceive themselves as the indigenous population of Bahrain. These people hark back to an ancient Baharna kingdom that stretched across Eastern Arabia. Although the historical accuracy of this narrative is disputed, it has played a powerful role in mobilizing support against the Sunni Khalifa dynasty, who are perceived as foreign occupiers of the Baharna homeland."
 legacy_of_the_gulf_war:0 "Legacy of the Gulf War"
 legacy_of_the_gulf_war_desc:0 "On August 2nd 1990 Saddam Hussein's Iraq invaded the State of Kuwait and occupied the country for a period of seven months. During that time a resistance movement mobilized against the Iraqi invaders, with all Kuwaitis regardless of sect or social class coming together to fight against the occupiers. This event, along with a long history of Kuwait standing against much larger adversaries and boasting a uniquely powerful parliament, has helped cement a Kuwaiti national identity that, unlike in some of Kuwait's fellow Gulf states, has allowed Sunni and Shi'a to co-exist relatively seamlessly."
 unrepresentative_government:0 "Unrepresentative Government"
 unrepresentative_government_sunni_desc:0 "This country, despite being majority-Shi'a, is ruled by a Sunni government. This imbalance of power has contributed to sectarian friction and popular resentment towards what is perceived as an unjust and unrepresentative government."

 israeli_settlements_desc:0 "Shortly after the Israeli victory in the Six Day War of 1967 that saw Israel seize control of the West Bank from Jordan, a group of Zionist activists staying in a hotel in Hebron refused to leave. The Israeli government sought to compromise with the activists by establishing the first Jewish settlement in the West Bank, in doing so preventing Palestinian herders from continuing to use that land. That event began a trend that has continued to this day, with over a hundred settlements being established, to the growing chagrin of the Palestinian population."
 israeli_blockade:0 "Israeli Blockade"
 israeli_blockade_desc:0 "Since Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip from Fatah in 2007, Egypt and Israel have enforced a land, air and sea blockade of Gaza. While Israel has maintained that the blockade is legal under international law and that it is necessary to guarantee Israeli security and put pressure on a violent terrorist organization, humanitarian and intergovernmental organizations have accused Israel of inflicting collective punishment on the people of Gaza through the blockade, forcing the territory's inhabitants to remain dependent on humanitarian aid."
 palestinian_resistance:0 "Palestinian Resistance"
 palestinian_resistance_desc:0 "Ever since Zionist settlers first arrived in Palestine in the late 1800s, tensions between Jewish immigrants and the Palestinian population have often led to outbreaks of violence between the two communities. After the creation of Israel, Palestinian groups and even individuals have launched attacks against Israeli interests, a phenomenon that has persisted despite the signing of the Oslo Accords. This has been due to widespread Palestinian dissatisfaction about the continuing construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Israel's refusal to share control of Jerusalem among other grievances. These attacks have contributed to a sense of Israeli insecurity and support for hardline political forces."
 large_refugee_population:0 "Large Refugee Population"
 large_refugee_population_desc:0 "The 1948 Arab-Israeli War resulted in what Palestinians call al-Nakba, the catastrophe. This event saw a mass exodus of the Palestinian population from Israeli-controlled territory, leading to the establishment of large refugee camps in neighboring Arab countries. These refugees live a precarious existence, as many governments have not granted citizenship to Palestinian refugees, thereby often denying them of the right to work and access public services. These refugees yearn to return to the homes that their families owned prior to 1948, producing a difficult issue to resolve given the fact that much of the land formerly owned by these refugees is now inhabited by Israelis."

 gulf_society:0 "Islamism & Secularism"
 gulf_society_desc:0 "Our country's society remains deeply religious. As a consequence our government's continued popularity relies on our religious credentials, and as such we must be cautious about pursuing policies that could lead to accusations of impiety. The existence of alternative sources of religious legitimacy in the form of populist Islamist groups poses a constant threat to our power. If the popularity of such groups gets out of hand, we may have to consider a broad crackdown.\n\nA major factor in our government's religious legitimacy is our adherance to conservative social values.
