# Millennium Dawn Tools

```

## Directory of Scripts

1. **calculate_days**: Script that counts and calculates the days from January 1st

## Old Folder

The directory named old is a large number of unused or out dated tools that are no longer in use. They are there for historical purposes but they are not expected to be used.
