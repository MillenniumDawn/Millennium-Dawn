What we do have is a vote at the UN, and a few powerful neighbours that are very concerned with geopolitics. Our closest developed neighbour is [?AST.GetName|Y] and they've traditionally been a good friend to have. But [?CHI.GetName|Y] is a growing power with a gigantic economy, and great interest in gaining votes at the UN..."
