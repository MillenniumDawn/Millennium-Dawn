 western_desc:0 "Western and Pro-Western governments seek to retain the US-centric Liberal World Order that has reigned supreme since the fall of the Soviet Union. Through institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF, they promote economic liberalization and denationalization. While the vast majority of countries with a Western Outlook are various forms of democracies, Pro-Western strongman governments that benefit from the status quo are also behind them."
 emerging_desc:0 "Governments with an Emerging Outlook are those, especially in the Global South and Post-Soviet Sphere, that seek to replace the prevailing Liberal World Order with their own alternate institutions and multipolar way of global politics. They often have differing attitudes towards globalization, forms of government, and domestic policy."
 salafist_desc:0 "Salafism is an ultraconservative, intolerant, and fundamentalist offshoot of mainstream Sunni Islam. It has grown in prominence as the Wahabi Gulf Monarchies provided billions in funding for its teachings since the mid-20th century. Salafism has seen particularly violent incarnations in the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and ISIS. They seek to conquer all Islamic lands and rule them through their harsh interpretation of Islamic Law. They do not recognize other forms of Islam nor minority religions, and will stop at nothing to achieve their goals."
 non_aligned_desc:0 "Non-Aligned governments vary vastly in government types and sub-ideologies, and usually have an very pragmatic approach to their foreign alignments. They may want to further their own national independence or other regional goals, or simply are torn between greater powers, who in their struggle for influence pull them in different directions."
 nationalism_desc:0 "Nationalistic governments believe they have gotten the short stick of globalization, and seek a national rebirth based on protectionism, militarization, and national and ethnic sovereignty. They loathe global liberal institutions, but may remain pragmatic in their international alignments to further their narrow domestic or expansionist goals."
