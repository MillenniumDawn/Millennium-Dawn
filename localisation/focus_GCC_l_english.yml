 GCC_socio_economic_affairs:0 "Socio-Economic Affairs"
 GCC_socio_economic_affairs_desc:0 "The economy and society of [ROOT.GetNameDef] yield interesting challenges. Many argue that our current dependence on oil is unsustainable and outsiders have criticized our policies towards foreign migrants. Moreover, voices from both within and without are clamoring for improvements in the rights of women."
 GCC_the_rentier_state:0 "The Rentier State"
 GCC_the_rentier_state_desc:0 "The [ROOT.GetAdjective] economy is commonly characterized as that of a rentier state. This is due to how our income is derived from external oil "rents". This income is then distributed to our subjects in the form of subsidies and welfare, allowing our country to function without a tax system or representative government. However, it is a well-known fact that one day the oil that this system depends upon will run out."
 GCC_expand_oil_extraction:0 "Expand Oil Extraction"
 GCC_expand_oil_extraction_desc:0 "While the need to diversify our economy is clear, that does not mean that we need to put an immediate stop to our oil extraction activities."
 GCC_joint_ventures:0 "Joint Ventures"
 GCC_joint_ventures_desc:0 "While [fossil_fuel_industry_name] is perfectly capable of carrying out its oil extraction activities on its own, it could still benefit from the resources and technological knowhow of other oil firms."
 GCC_total_sa:0 "Total S.A."
 GCC_total_sa_desc:0 "Total is a French oil and gas company and one of the seven "Supermajor" oil companies."
 GCC_royal_dutch_shell:0 "Royal Dutch Shell"
 GCC_royal_dutch_shell_desc:0 "Shell is an Ango-Dutch firm and the third-largest company in the world. Its resources and expertise accumulated over more than a century could be a great asset for [fossil_fuel_industry_name]."
 GCC_lukoil:0 "Lukoil"
 GCC_lukoil_desc:0 "The Russian energy giant Lukoil may not have the long history of some of its European competitors, but it has nonetheless grown rapidly to become one of the world's largest oil producers."
 GCC_sinopec:0 "Sinopec"
 GCC_sinopec_desc:0 "The China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation or Sinopec is the world's largest oil refining, gas and petrochemical conglomerate and can therefore draw upon immense financial resources."
 GCC_stock_market_listing:0 "Stock Market Listing"
 GCC_stock_market_listing_desc:0 "An initial public offering (IPO) of [fossil_fuel_industry_name] will in many ways act as a litmus test of our country's stability. If domestic and international investors have confidence in our country the IPO will be a success, but it may also fail to raise substantial sums of money. The amount of money raised by our IPO will determine how much we can contribute to our sovereign wealth fund."
 GCC_sovereign_wealth_fund:0 "Sovereign Wealth Fund"
 GCC_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc:0 "The windfall from the IPO can bolster our sovereign wealth fund, improving our ability to make investments abroad as well as to finance public services and infrastructure projects at home."
 GCC_secure_the_fossil_fuel_industry:0 "Secure the Fossil Fuel Industry"
 GCC_secure_the_fossil_fuel_industry_desc:0 "State control over [fossil_fuel_industry_name] has served us well in the past and shall continue to do so. Even without direct ownership over the company, our government can keep [fossil_fuel_industry_name] on a tight leash and prevent it from becoming too autonomous."
 GCC_untether_the_fossil_fuel_industry:0 "Untether the Fossil Fuel Industry"
 GCC_untether_the_fossil_fuel_industry_desc:0 "For decades we have maintained tight control over [fossil_fuel_industry_name], but with the IPO the time has come to relinquish our iron grip. Such a move will undoubtedly anger those who currently benefit from state control and will allow an independent power base to form in the company's leadership. However relinquishing control will allow the company to more effeciently carry out its activities."
 GCC_innovative_techniques:0 "Innovative Techniques"
 GCC_innovative_techniques_desc:0 "The 21st century brings new challenges and new opportunities. We must use these opportunities to develop new and intelligent ways to overcome the challenges involved in oil extraction."
 GCC_deepen_the_safety_net:0 "Deepen the Safety Net"
 GCC_deepen_the_safety_net_desc:0 "Our system of rule relies on the distribution of wealth to our citizens through public services. We can put our oil revenues towards an expansion of this system of patronage. This will shore up support for our government."
 GCC_subsidize_economic_activity:0 "Subsidize Economic Activity"
 GCC_subsidize_economic_activity_desc:0 "Subsidies for the business activities of our merchant class is another major avenue of patronage provision which our authority depends on. Not only will increasing subsidies with our oil revenues shore up the merchant class's support for our government, but it will also help stimulate the [ROOT.GetAdjective] economy."
 GCC_reinforce_patronage_networks:0 "Reinforce Patronage Networks"
 GCC_reinforce_patronage_networks_desc:0 "While our subjects and the merchant class are important sources of support for our government, there are other political forces whose loyalty is even more crucial to our government's survival. We should reinforce the patronage networks that guarantee the loyalty of these political actors."
 GCC_invest_in_the_metal_industry:0 "Invest in the Metal Industry"
 GCC_invest_in_the_metal_industry_desc:0 "While our country is most known for the extraction and export of fossil fuels, God has also gifted our country with light metals. While focusing on the extraction of these raw materials will do little to diversify our economy, it will provide useful short-term benefits."
 GCC_diversify_the_economy:0 "Diversify the Economy"
 GCC_diversify_the_economy_desc:0 "In order to reduce our reliance on oil we should invest in other sectors of the economy particular the secondary and tertiary sectors relating to manufacturing and services. This will be no easy task and will inevitably encounter opposition from those who benefit from the status quo."
 GCC_shrink_the_safety_net:0 "Shrink the Safety Net"
 GCC_shrink_the_safety_net_desc:0 "Our current provision of social services is important to our government's legitimacy but is bloated and unsustainable. We must make necessary cuts in order to further the diversification of our economy."
 GCC_private_sector_job_creation:0 "Private Sector Job Creation"
 GCC_private_sector_job_creation_desc:0 "Our government has historically employed the majority of citizens in the public sector. While this has ensured stable employment for the people of [ROOT.GetNameDef], it is not a state of affairs that is conducive to a dynamic and diversified economy. We should open up space within the private sector for former public sector employees but this will naturally involve a shrinking of the public sector."
 GCC_construction_boom:0 "Construction Boom"
 GCC_construction_boom_desc:0 "Investing in construction is essential to achieving a diversified economy."
 GCC_support_the_aviation_sector:0 "Support the Aviation Sector"
 GCC_support_the_aviation_sector_desc:0 "Airlines from Etihad to Qatar Airways have bolstered the international image of their home countries and are unique enterprises in otherwise oil-dominated economies. We should support our domestic aviation industry to capitalize on this reputation and increase our progress towards diversification."
 GCC_support_the_entertainment_industry:0 "Support the Entertainment Industry"
 GCC_support_the_entertainment_industry_desc:0 "Film and music are areas in which our country is decidedly lacking. Supporting these sectors of the economy will not only develop useful economic opportunities but will also increase our government's support among the wider population. However, this policy's contradiction with fundamentalist Islamic values may make us enemies in some quarters."
 GCC_support_manufacturing:0 "Support Manufacturing"
 GCC_support_manufacturing_desc:0 "Because of our country's vast natural resources, [ROOT.GetNameDef] has never fully industrialized. In addition to developing the service sector, we should also support our budding manufacturing industry."
 GCC_the_dubai_model:0 "The Dubai Model"
 GCC_the_dubai_model_desc:0 "Dubai has developed a unique economic model by the standards of the Gulf, one that has successfully reduced the Emirate's reliance on oil. However, this model of encouraging foreign investment and tourism has come at a cost, with many residents of Dubai feeling disenchanted with Westernization and uneven economic growth. Pursuing this model may be a pathway to diversification for [ROOT.GetNameDef], but it will be resisted."
 GCC_reduce_vice_prevention:0 "Reduce Vice Prevention"
 GCC_reduce_vice_prevention_desc:0 "In order to attract foreigners to our country we must first relax some of our more austere laws, particularly those regarding the prohibition of alcohol and restrictions on clothing. However, these actions will not be without consequences."
 GCC_court_tourism_and_foreign_businesses:0 "Court Tourism and Foreign Businesses"
 GCC_court_tourism_and_foreign_businesses_desc:0 "Now that we have sufficiently relaxed our social laws, we have paved the way for foreign investment to support our domestic infrastructure and for the tourism sector to act as an alternative to oil."
 GCC_end_the_rentier_state:0 "End the Rentier State"
 GCC_end_the_rentier_state_desc:0 "The rentier state depends upon a constant stream of oil revenue. Given that this is no longer possible, it is high time that we put an end to the rentier state and find alternative sources of legitimacy."
 GCC_end_oil_dependency:0 "End Oil Dependency"
 GCC_end_oil_dependency_desc:0 "Our diversification efforts have finally borne fruit. The [ROOT.GetAdjective] economy no longer has to depend solely on the production and export of fossil fuels, paving the way for a more sustainable future."
 GCC_empower_industrial_conglomerates:0 "Empower Industrial Conglomerates"
 GCC_empower_industrial_conglomerates_desc:0 "Our support for manufacturing has allowed industrial conglomerates to begin accumulating capital and influence. Supporting this new economic force will help consolidate our burgeoning secondary sector but will create a new power base that could seek to influence government policy."
 GCC_commit_to_domestic_merchants:0 "Commit to Domestic Merchants"
 GCC_commit_to_domestic_merchants_desc:0 "The merchant class has historically been key to the economy of [ROOT.GetNameDef] and as such has wielded significant influence in [ROOT.GetAdjective] affairs. We should remain committed to supporting these merchants in order to preserve the existing internal balance of power."
 GCC_cater_to_investors:0 "Cater to Investors"
 GCC_cater_to_investors_desc:0 "The future lies not in manufacturing or in traditional forms of commerce but in modern finance. As such we should develop [ROOT.GetNameDef] as a regional financial hub in order to insure our global relevance in this post-oil era."
 GCC_migrant_rights:0 "Migrant Rights"
 GCC_migrant_rights_desc:0 "Our unique demographic situation warrants attention. While our economy depends on the continued influx of migrants from the rest of the Middle East and South Asia, some of our subjects fear a dilution of [ROOT.GetAdjective] identity. In addition, we have drawn criticism for the poor conditions in which many migrants in [ROOT.GetNameDef] work in and the limited legal protections our government offers them."
 GCC_inclusive_policies:0 "Inclusive Policies"
 GCC_inclusive_policies_desc:0 "It is time for [ROOT.GetNameDef] to accept the centrality of immigrants in our society. We should do what we can to improve their living conditions and welcome them to this great country."
 GCC_amend_the_kafala_system:0 "Amend the Kafala System"
 GCC_amend_the_kafala_system_desc:0 "The kafala system requires migrant laborers to have in-country sponsers, in practice making them heavily dependent on their employers, opening them up to exploitation and abuse. Naturally, attempts to reform this system will be met with opposition from our country's various employers of migrant labor."
 GCC_minimum_wage:0 "Minimum Wage"
 GCC_minimum_wage_desc:0 "The lack of a minimum wage for migrant laborers has contributed to their poor living conditions and over-dependence on their employers. Their standard of living could be improved significantly by introducing one. However, this move will likely have an adverse effect on our economic activity."
 GCC_open_pathways_to_citizenship:0 "Open Pathways to Citizenship"
 GCC_open_pathways_to_citizenship_desc:0 "As long as migrants in [ROOT.GetNameDef] are denied citizenship they will remain subjugated and oppressed. We should make it easier for foreigners who have resided in this country for long enough to acquire citizenship. While this will increase our popularity with naturalized citizens, this policy will likely have the opposite effect on local residents, thereby increasing support for nativist political forces."
 GCC_exclusive_policies:0 "Exclusive Policies"
 GCC_exclusive_policies_desc:0 "The flood of migrants coming into [ROOT.GetNameDef] is a threat to our culture and our identity. We should protect the [ROOT.GetAdjective] people from this threat."
 GCC_reverse_naturalization:0 "Reverse Naturalization"
 GCC_reverse_naturalization_desc:0 "Although little naturalization of foreign migrants has taken place, we must revoke the citizenship of those foreigners who have managed to gain citizenship and prevent any further naturalization."
 GCC_impose_quotas:0 "Impose Quotas"
 GCC_impose_quotas_desc:0 "We should limit the number of migrants coming into the country to reduce the rate at which [ROOT.GetAdjective] culture is being eroded."
 GCC_maintain_exploitation:0 "Maintain Exploitation"
 GCC_maintain_exploitation_desc:0 "While we resent the corrupting influence of foreign migrants on our society and have done everything in our power to guard against the threat they pose, we must accept the necessity of foreign migrants for our continued economic growth."
 GCC_accelerated_growth:0 "Accelerated Growth"
 GCC_accelerated_growth_desc:0 "Our decision to ignore pressure to reform the kafala system has allowed us to continue utilizing our migrant population to its fullest extent."
 GCC_mass_deportation:0 "Mass Deportation"
 GCC_mass_deportation_desc:0 "Foreigners are a corrupting influence on our society and must be expelled for the good of the nation."
 GCC_empower_the_mutaween:0 "Favor Piety"
 GCC_empower_the_mutaween_desc:0 "The sharia is an important foundation of our legal system. However, there is more that we can do. The gradual, insidious encroachment of liberal values on our religious society must be stopped."
 GCC_weaken_the_mutaween:0 "Favor Reform"
 GCC_weaken_the_mutaween_desc:0 "The gradual trend in recent years in the region has been towards social liberalization. Instead of resisting this trend we should do what we can to support it."
 GCC_womens_rights:0 "Women's Rights"
 GCC_womens_rights_desc:0 "The fate of [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s women lies, as it always has, in the hands of [ROOT.GetAdjective] men. We must decide whether we wish to change this state of affairs or preserve the patriarchal status quo. Regardless of the approach we take, the status of our women is central to our identity as a nation."
 GCC_women_in_the_economy:0 "Women in the Economy"
 GCC_women_in_the_economy_desc:0 "Women have recently started to become more prominent in the business community, but this trend is still at an early stage. There is ample room for us to either support this trend or to combat it."
 GCC_women_in_politics:0 "Women in Politics"
 GCC_women_in_politics_desc:0 "The vast majority of official posts remain filled by men. We must decide whether to strive for gender equality or to keep women out of the political sphere."
 GCC_reform_personal_status_laws:0 "Reform Personal Status Laws"
 GCC_reform_personal_status_laws_desc:0 "The personal status laws are the area of our legal code that draws most upon sharia principles. As such, these laws heavily discriminate against women, for example by stating that legally a man is worth two women. Outdated laws like this should be revisited."
 GCC_political_affairs:0 "Political Affairs"
 GCC_political_affairs_desc:0 "Our rule faces many threats. Pro-democracy activists, Islamist radicals and so on directly challenge the legitimacy of our government. Whether we should take the criticisms of these detractors on board or harshly clamp down upon them is up to us."
 GCC_constitutional_monarchy:0 "Constitutional Monarchy"
 GCC_constitutional_monarchy_desc:0 "The time has come for the royal family to delegate some limited powers to an elected legislature. This will allow us to preserve our privileged position and the majority of our political authority while reducing pro-democracy pressure, at least for now."
 GCC_universal_suffrage:0 "Universal Suffrage"
 GCC_universal_suffrage_desc:0 "Allowing the entirety of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] population to elect legislators will prevent accusations of discrimination and prejudice being made against our government."
 GCC_permit_activism:0 "Permit Activism"
 GCC_permit_activism_desc:0 "While in the past we have not tolerated criticism of our government outside of controlled petitions, our position is secure enough for us to permit the operation of activist groups."
 GCC_empower_parliament:0 "Empower Parliament"
 GCC_empower_parliament_desc:0 "Parliament remains constrained by our constitution, with the vast majority of authority remaining in the hands of the royal family. This has led to popular demands for more authority being delegated to our elected legislature, demands that we should listen to."
 GCC_end_censorship:0 "End Censorship"
 GCC_end_censorship_desc:0 "While censorship does help guard against threats to our authority, it stifles constructive popular discourse and feeds resentment towards our government."
 GCC_free_and_fair_elections:0 "Fully Democratic Government"
 GCC_free_and_fair_elections_desc:0 "While our reforms have led to a democratically-elected legislature that acts as a check on our power, we have so far maintained the royal family's control over the appointment of government officials. Popular calls for further democratization can no longer be ignored, and it is high time that we open these positions up to electoral contestation."
 GCC_empower_baath_supporters:0 "Empower Ba'ath Supporters"
 GCC_empower_baath_supporters_desc:0 "The once great Ba'ath party and the Arab nationalist cause has suffered from division and defeat across the region. Now that we have opened up the political space in our country, we can make [ROOT.GetNameDef] a new base for the Ba'ath party and its mix of socialist and nationalist ideology."
 GCC_empower_shia_democrats:0 "Empower Shi'a Democrats"
 GCC_empower_shia_democrats_desc:0 "Our Shi'a citizens are clamoring for representation, and deservedly so. We should lend our support to the various pro-democracy groups that represent the Shi'a people."
 GCC_empower_sunni_democrats:0 "Empower Sunni Democrats"
 GCC_empower_sunni_democrats_desc:0 "Pluralist Sunni Islam was one of the most prominent forms of opposition to our government during [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s period of authoritarian rule. The religious values of groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, as well as the close connections to the community through networks of informal support and welfare provision, reinforce their popular support."
 GCC_empower_western_based_dissidents:0 "Empower Western-Based Groups"
 GCC_empower_western_based_dissidents_desc:0 "In past decades exiled activists have formed opposition groups in exile in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and so on. These groups have been more influenced by Western, liberal values than the domestic opposition, but do not command the same level of popular support due to them being perceived as more distant and out of touch."
 GCC_defensive_nationalism:0 "Defensive Nationalism"
 GCC_defensive_nationalism_desc:0 "Our state faces many external threats. The best way to respond to these threats is not to overstretch ourselves by getting involved overseas, but by focusing on defending our national borders and preserving our internal unity."
 GCC_aggressive_nationalism:0 "Aggressive Nationalism"
 GCC_aggressive_nationalism_desc:0 "The best defense is a good offense. The state of [ROOT.GetNameDef] must be prepared to strike overseas in order to protect our national integrity."
 GCC_irredentist_rhetoric:0 "Irredentist Rhetoric"
 GCC_irredentist_rhetoric_desc:0 "[irredentist_rhetoric_description]"
 GCC_irredentist_rhetoric_desc_BHR:0 "The Baharna are a proud people spread across Eastern Arabia. They once ruled a vast territory that spanned the entirety of Eastern Arabia. Since then the Baharna have suffered from the oppression of foreign conquerers. The Al-Khalifa and Al-Saud dynasties have unjustly presided over and divided a once great people. Freed from their yoke, the people of Bahrain will be restored to their former glory."
 GCC_irredentist_rhetoric_desc_KUW:0 "The 1922 Uqair Convention divided a portion of Kuwaiti territory between our government and that of Najd, modern day Saudi Arabia. This divided zone is rich in oil and the Saudis therefore currently possess oil wealth that is rightfully ours. We should take back the Saudi-controlled portion of the Divided Zone and the oil extraction opportunities that it confers."
 GCC_irredentist_rhetoric_desc_OMA:0 "The Yemeni province of al-Mahra has close historical and cultural ties to the Omani province of Dhofar. The Maharis, like ourselves, are largely Sufi Muslim and are clearly distinct from the rest of Yemen. We have already facilitated the migration of Maharis to Oman in past years by providing them with Omani citizenship, but our ultimate goal should be the separation of al-Mahra from Yemen."
 GCC_irredentist_rhetoric_desc_QAT:0 "Bahrain's ownership over the rightfully Qatari Hawar islands is an affront to our national pride. Our sovereignty over the islands could easily be restored in the event that Bahrain ceases to exist."
 GCC_irredentist_rhetoric_desc_SAU:0 "Abdulaziz estabished what would become Saudi Arabia through an ambitious conquest of the Arabian peninsula. That conquest was necessarily limited at the time by British protection of the Emirates along the Eastern Arabian coast and the Hashemite kingdoms. Now that a check on our regional expansion no longer exists, we are free to unify the entirety of the Arabian peninsula under one banner."
 GCC_irredentist_rhetoric_desc_UAE:0 "Bahrain and Qatar should have joined the union that was formed in 1971 that established the United Arab Emirates. For our country to reach its fully glory, these two rogue emirates cannot be allowed to remain independent and should be restored to the union by force if necessary."
 GCC_favor_khomeinism:0 "Favor Khomeinism"
 GCC_favor_khomeinism_desc:0 "The principle of Wilayat al-Faqih is a popular Shi'a principle popularized by Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini which puts power in the hands of a faqih, or Islamic jurist. The principle is shared by groups allied to the Islamic Republic of Iran such as the various offshoots of Hezbollah, and as such binds together a Shi'a identity that transcends borders."
 GCC_favor_the_shiraziyyin:0 "Favor the Shiraziyyin"
 GCC_favor_the_shiraziyyin_desc:0 "The Shiraziyyin, or followers of al-Shirazi, adhere to the teachings of the prominent Shi'a religious leader Mohammad al-Shirazi who fell out with Ayatollah Khomeini due to his opposition to wilayat al-faqih. As a result of this schism, Shirazi movements in the Gulf have usually sought autonomy from Iran and focused their attention on national issues rather than transnational ones."
 GCC_maintain_tradition:0 "Maintain Tradition"
 GCC_maintain_tradition_desc:0 "Our liberalization of the political sphere does not mean that we should seek a complete departure from our local traditions in favor of a wholly Western, liberal society. Our state should continue to be governed in accordance with Islamic principles and the values of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] people should be respected."
 GCC_westernization_policies:0 "Westernization Policies"
 GCC_westernization_policies_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetAdjective] society cannot progress if it remains rooted in old-fashioned traditions. Our nation must undergo rapid liberalizing reforms in order to become a civilized member of the international community."
 GCC_religious_subsidies:0 "Religious Subsidies"
 GCC_religious_subsidies_desc:0 "We should demonstrate our government's continued support for [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s religious institutions by providing them with government subsidies."
 GCC_ideological_partners:0 "Ideological Partners"
 GCC_ideological_partners_desc:0 "The Middle East is a dangerous region. We are threatened on all sides by hostile forces and as such must strengthen our relations with states that share our ideological alignment."
 GCC_establish_a_republic:0 "Establish a Republic"
 GCC_establish_a_republic_desc:0 "While we have tolerated the continuation of the monarchy in a symbolic capacity so far, their continued existence remains an affront to our democratic values. The people of [ROOT.GetNameDef] will never truly be free of their authoritarian legacy until they free themselves of the royal family."
 GCC_preserve_the_royal_family:0 "Preserve the Royal Family"
 GCC_preserve_the_royal_family_desc:0 "The continued existence of the royal family clearly does not pose a threat to our democracy. All their authority has been stripped away, and their power over elected officials has been eliminated. Why jeopardize [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s stability by destroying an institution of this country that is still looked upon fondly by many?"
 GCC_break_the_religious_establishment:0 "Break the Religious Establishment"
 GCC_break_the_religious_establishment_desc:0 "For too long the [ROOT.GetAdjective] government's policy-making has been beholden to the ulema, or Muslim scholars, who have either supported or opposed government policies depending on their interpretation of Islamic law. While we have managed to liberalize our government significantly, the ulema remains a major obstacle to our society's progress, an obstacle that should be removed."
 GCC_absolute_monarchy:0 "Absolute Monarchy"
 GCC_absolute_monarchy_desc:0 "The answer to criticism of our government is not to give in to the demands of dangerous populists by initiating democratic reforms. Instead, we should utilize the greater opportunities for societal control that the 21st century offers us to entrench our government's authority. Maintaining the absolute control of the monarchy over the country is the only way to preserve stability."
 GCC_anti_corruption_drive:0 "Anti-Corruption Drive"
 GCC_anti_corruption_drive_desc:0 "Corruption is undeniably an issue in [ROOT.GetNameDef]. It may be to our benefit to go after those members of the royal family who are engaged in corrupt activities, especially those who pose the greatest threat to [ROOT.GetLeader]'s authority..."
 GCC_reinforce_tribal_ties:0 "Reinforce Tribal Ties"
 GCC_reinforce_tribal_ties_desc:0 "Our authority has always depended on the royal family's close links to the leaders of [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s various tribes. In order to secure our rule we should make sure that these bonds are as strong as ever."
 GCC_extend_control_over_the_ulema:0 "Extend Control Over the Ulema"
 GCC_extend_control_over_the_ulema_desc:0 "The ulema are an extremely influential part of [ROOT.GetAdjective] society and have served the interests of our government well in the past by issuing interpretations of Islamic law that justified our actions. However, they maintain a high degree of autonomy and as such may refuse to endorse certain policies. This autonomy must be eroded if the authority of the monarch is to remain supreme."
 GCC_bolster_the_security_services:0 "Bolster the Security Services"
 GCC_bolster_the_security_services_desc:0 "Our country's police and intelligence services are indispensable for the security of our regime and, by extension, the safety of [ROOT.GetNameDef]. They should be given all the resources that they need to combat dangerous destabilizing elements in [ROOT.GetAdjective] society."
 GCC_centralize_power:0 "Centralize Power"
 GCC_centralize_power_desc:0 "The biggest threat to [ROOT.GetLeader]'s authority comes not from jihadists or democrats but from rival members of the royal family. The sheer size of the royal family means that many figures opposed to [ROOT.GetLeader]'s rule have been able to retain their own power centers within the government. These alternative sources of authority must be eliminated."
 GCC_pro_government_indoctrination:0 "Pro-Government Indoctrination"
 GCC_pro_government_indoctrination_desc:0 "The school and the mosque are key locations in which the opinions of [ROOT.GetAdjective]s are shaped and moulded. We should put pressure on these institutions to espouse pro-government views and instill a sense of patriotism in the [ROOT.GetAdjective] people."
 GCC_enhanced_surveillance:0 "Constant Surveillance"
 GCC_enhanced_surveillance_desc:0 "While the majority of [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s citizens are loyal and patriotic, we must keep a close eye on the entirety of our population to make sure that subversive elements do not emerge under our noses."
 GCC_a_cult_of_personality:0 "A Cult of Personality"
 GCC_a_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] should not simply be feared by his enemies, but also loved by his people. Through the control over [ROOT.GetAdjective] society that we have secured we can convince the [ROOT.GetAdjective] population that this country's success and good fortune is tied directly to the guiding hand of our glorious leader, whose will is one with that of Allah."
 GCC_build_a_totalitarian_state:0 "Build a Totalitarian State"
 GCC_build_a_totalitarian_state_desc:0 "Our consolidation of the state is now complete. We have built a society that unconditionally loves [ROOT.GetLeader] and his government.
