 HOL_economy.01.t: "Borsele Renovation Plans"
 HOL_economy.01.d: "The future of the Borssele nuclear reactor is in your hands. You have two options: expand the reactor's capacity to increase nuclear energy output or refurbish it into a state-of-the-art clean coal plant. Expanding the reactor will boost energy efficiency and innovation, while converting to clean coal will enhance industrial capacity and stability. Choose wisely, as this decision will shape the energy landscape of the Netherlands."
 HOL_economy.01.a: "Go Nuclear"

 HOL_economy.02.t: "Netherlands Propose Wunderline Railway"
 HOL_economy.02.d:  "The Netherlands has put forward an ambitious proposal to develop the Wunderline railway, a state-of-the-art cross-border connection aimed at enhancing regional connectivity between the two nations. This project, envisioned as a cornerstone of future economic cooperation, would modernize existing infrastructure, improve travel times, and bolster the relationship between the Netherlands and Germany. The proposal reflects the Netherlands' commitment to advancing its transportation network and fostering stronger ties with its neighbors."
 HOL_economy.02.a: "Wunderbar!"
 HOL_economy.02.b: "No we stick with rusty trains"
 HOL_economy.03.t: "Germany Doesn't Want a Wunderline"
 HOL_economy.03.d: "Despite the Netherlands' diplomatic efforts and the potential benefits of the Wunderline railway, Germany has decided not to support the project. This rejection poses a significant setback to the Netherlands' vision of a more interconnected Europe. With Germany’s refusal, the future of the Wunderline hangs in the balance. The Netherlands must now decide whether to proceed with a scaled-down version of the project, focusing on connecting to Groningen, or to abandon the plan entirely, acknowledging the limitations of regional cooperation."
 HOL_economy.03.a: "Build Railway to Groningen atleast"
 HOL_economy.03.b: "Scrap The Plan"
 HOL_economy.04.t: "Netherlands Propose HSL-Oost Integration"
 HOL_economy.04.d: "In a bid to further integrate European transportation networks, the Netherlands has proposed the integration of the HSL-Oost high-speed railway into Germany's existing infrastructure. This initiative aims to create a seamless, fast connection between the two countries, potentially revolutionizing travel and economic interactions across the border. If successful, this project could not only enhance the efficiency of cross-border transportation but also strengthen the economic ties and cooperation between the Netherlands and Germany, making it a key milestone in European integration."

 HOL_economy.05.t: "§Y[BEL.GetNameWithFlag]§! & Germany Rejects Three-Country Route"
 HOL_economy.05.d: "In a disappointing turn of events, both §Y[BEL.GetNameWithFlag]§! and Germany have rejected the proposal for the Three-Country Route, effectively halting the Netherlands' vision of a comprehensive cross-border rail network. This rejection is a significant setback, forcing the Netherlands to reevaluate its transportation strategy. With the original plan no longer viable, the focus must shift to alternative options, such as improving existing routes within Dutch borders or reallocating resources to other national projects. The outcome highlights the challenges of international cooperation and the complexities of regional infrastructure development."
 HOL_economy.05.a: "Only Reconstruct Maastricht Station"
 HOL_economy.05.b: "Use Funds to invest in the Amsterdam - Maastricht Line"
 HOL_economy.05.c: "They really hate reliable trains"
 HOL_economy.06.t: "Netherlands suggest Three-Country Route with §Y[BEL.GetNameWithFlag]§!"
 HOL_economy.06.d: "The Netherlands has taken a bold step by proposing a new Three-Country Route, an ambitious rail project intended to connect the Netherlands, §Y[BEL.GetNameWithFlag]§!, and Germany through a comprehensive rail network. This project is seen as a potential game-changer for cross-border transportation, with the promise of enhancing trade, travel, and economic integration among the three nations.
