 project_threshold.1.t: "The Zenobia and Saladin Lines are Under Construction"
 project_threshold.1.d: "In response to the growing threat emerging from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle Eastern Alliance has authorized the rapid construction of a fortified defense line along the southern Nile and western desert sectors of Egypt. Designated the Zenobia Line, this position will anchor heavy artillery emplacements, trench systems across key approach vectors.\n\nShould the Zenobia line fall, the Saladin line stands strong behind it. Spanning the entire canal zone from Port Said to the Red Sea, this fortification will act as the absolute defense line.\n"

 project_threshold.300.t: "CERN Reaches Beyond"
 project_threshold.300.d: "Researchers at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) have successfully conducted a controlled high-energy collision resulting in the temporary creation of what is being described as a 'localized interdimensional anomaly.'\n\nWhile the rift was measured at the subatomic level and lasted only a fraction of a nanosecond, it marks the first recorded instance of energy signatures not consistent with known physical laws. Initial containment protocols held, and no material transfer was observed—but the implications are already sending shockwaves through the global scientific community.\n\n The line between theoretical and real has just blurred."
 project_threshold.300.a: "Is this truly safe?"

 project_threshold.301.t: "UN Convoy Missing in Central Africa"
 project_threshold.301.d: "A United Nations humanitarian convoy operating in the border region between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo has gone dark. Satellite imagery shows signs of wreckage and overturned vehicles scattered along a jungle route, but no distress signals were received.\n\nNo survivors or bodies were recovered. No rebel faction has claimed responsibility. The cause of the incident remains officially unknown."
 project_threshold.301.a: "Another attack on UN peacekeepers..."

 project_threshold.302.t: "Unusual Seismic Activity in the Tarim Basin"
 project_threshold.302.d: "A cluster of shallow, high-frequency tremors has been recorded in the Tarim Basin, western China. The seismic patterns are inconsistent with natural tectonic movement or known subterranean activity. Chinese authorities have not released a statement, but regional seismology data quietly shared through a university exchange program has raised eyebrows among geophysicists."
 project_threshold.302.a: "The readings don’t make sense"

 project_threshold.303.t: "Radio Silence in the Pamirs"
 project_threshold.303.d: "A high-altitude PLA listening post near the Chinese-Tajik border has ceased all communication. No official word has come from Beijing, but a Kazakh amateur radio operator reported hearing a brief emergency transmission in Mandarin before total silence. Intelligence satellites show visible signs of damage."
 project_threshold.303.a: "Was it a Tajik attack?"

 project_threshold.304.t: "Missing Rangers in Northern Alaska"
 project_threshold.304.d: "Two National Park rangers patrolling a remote sector of the Denali National Park have been declared missing after failing to check in for 72 hours. A search team was dispatched, only to discover their abandonned camp with clear signs of a struggle.\n\nWhile the story was only reported by local newspapers at first, it started to gain national and international traction when the search party also vanished without traces. The FBI has now opened an investigation and a manhunt is underway."
 project_threshold.304.a: "A murderer on the loose?"

 project_threshold.305.t: "Strange Outbreak in the Peruvian Highlands"
 project_threshold.305.d: "A remote village in the Andean highlands of southern Peru has been quarantined by regional health authorities following a mysterious outbreak. Initial reports describe fever, hallucinations, and acute sensory disorientation among locals. The symptoms emerged rapidly after a reported 'flash of light' and tremor felt only within a narrow valley near the village.\n\nPeruvian officials claim it is an isolated fungal infection, but NGOs operating nearby say medical teams have been escorted by military personnel. A geologist from the National University of San Marcos, part of a research team surveying nearby caves, is among the missing."
 project_threshold.305.a: "Keep us updated"

 project_threshold.306.t: "Unrest in Xinjiang: Military Base Attacked"
 project_threshold.306.d: "A violent incident has occurred near Kashgar, western Xinjiang. Chinese state media is silent, but intelligence reports indicate that Base 36, a PLA facility near Yecheng, was overrun by unidentified hostile elements during the night. Description given through radio made little sense as to the real nature of the attackers.\n\nThe People’s Liberation Army has begun emergency deployment of mechanized units and chemical response teams to the region. Transport planes were seen landing at the Kashgar airport in the early hours.\n\nIn a rare move, a Russian rapid response detachment has also crossed into China through the Kulma Pass."
 project_threshold.306.a: "Situation under control, according to Beijing"

 project_threshold.307.t: "Tactical Nuclear Detonation in Western China"
 project_threshold.307.d: "A tactical nuclear explosion was detected near the Taklamakan Desert, roughly 120 kilometers east of Kashgar. The blast occurred five days after PLA units were deployed to contain the unknown threat in the region.\n\nBoth Beijing and Moscow have denied any use of nuclear weapons, but seismic data confirms a low-yield detonation consistent with a Russian tactical warhead. Satellite images show scorched terrain, collapsed geological strata, and a rapidly expanding dark orb.\n\nInternational observers are pressing for answers, but official channels remain silent. Within military circles, speculation is growing that the strike was a unilateral decision by Russian field command under emergency engagement doctrine."
 project_threshold.307.a: "What's going on there?!"

 project_threshold.308.t: "The Veil is Torn"
 project_threshold.308.d: "Satellite images leaked by an unnamed intelligence source have gone viral worldwide: a vast, purple, pulsing orb looming over the scorched remains of the impact site with a swarm of creatures coming out of it. Scientists are at a loss to explain the images. The footage clearly shows that the nuclear strike failed to destroy it, and if anything, only caused it to grow. Within hours, three new portals of similar size and effect erupted:\n- In Northwestern Alaska\n- In the Kenyan highlands, near Mount Elgon\n- In southern Chile, near Cape Horn.\n\nReports are already pouring in that the creatures are highly aggressive. The age of normalcy is over."
 project_threshold.308.a: "The truth can no longer be denied"

 project_threshold.309.t: "The UN Convenes an Emergency Assembly"
 project_threshold.309.d: "With public panic mounting and confidence in national governments faltering, the United Nations has entered emergency session. The General Assembly has invoked rarely used crisis powers, and the Security Council is locked in urgent debate over coordinated response strategies.\n\nProposals range from global military cooperation to joint scientific task forces. Tensions are rising between the permanent members as blame circulates and agendas collide.\n\nBut if the early engagement reports are any indication, one truth is already clear: humanity must stand united or face extinction."
 project_threshold.309.a: "A global response begins to take form"

 project_threshold.310.t: "A United Command"
 project_threshold.310.d: "The UN emergency assembly has concluded with the creation of the UN Joint Command (UNJC). An international body tasked with coordinating military strategy, intelligence, and logistical support against the rapidly expanding extra-dimensional threat. While primarily advisory, the Command has been granted unprecedented operational latitude.\n\nIn parallel, regional blocs like the European Union have begun floating proposals for full political and military unification, citing the need for seamless mobilization and shared sovereignty in the face of extinction. What was once unthinkable is now discussed openly in parliaments across the continent."
 project_threshold.310.a: "One enemy. One war"

 project_threshold.400.t: "The Birth of the European Federation"
 project_threshold.400.d: "After months of political wrangling, emergency sessions, and mounting casualties, the European Union has voted to dissolve its supranational framework and reconstitute itself as a single federal mega-state: the European Federation.\n\nEven historically neutral countries like Switzerland and Finland, after prolonged internal debates and referendums, have chosen to join, citing the existential threat posed by the CHIMERAs. With national armies consolidated and borders erased, the European Federation now fields a unified command structure, pooled resources, and a single wartime government.\n\nCritics warn of hasty integration and loss of independence, but supporters argue nothing short of total unification will ensure survival."
 project_threshold.400.a: "Survival knows no borders"

 project_threshold.500.t: "The Discovery of Randallite"
 project_threshold.500.d: "Since the first portals tore into Earth, fragments of an unidentified metallic substance have been found around the world. Most assumed it was dimensional transformation of existing metals, strange but inert.\n\nThat changed today. Dr. Lisa Randall, a theoretical physicist and one of the world’s leading minds on higher-dimensional physics, has cracked the structure and properties of the material, revealing it as a stable, lightweight, and highly resilient metal with immense potential for military applications.\n\nNow dubbed Randallite, the substance is uniquely suited for advanced alloys, combining strength, heat resistance, and flexibility. With proper refinement, it may serve as the foundation for a new generation of war machines to help us win."
 project_threshold.500.a: "Finally some good news"

 project_threshold.501.t: "Prototype HACS Frame Unveiled"
 project_threshold.501.d: "After months of accelerated development, the first prototype frame of a High Mobility Combat System (HACS) has been successfully constructed.\n\nEngineered with a Randallite-reinforced bipedal chassis and equipped with integrated booster thrusters, the HACS platform was designed to bridge the gap between firepower, and survivability. Where tanks are too slow and aircraft too vulnerable to CHIMERA threats, HACS offer the needed mobility without sacrificing heavy weapon payloads.\n\nThough still in testing, this breakthrough marks a major step toward next-generation frontline units. A dedicated research program has been greenlit to bring HACS into combat-ready form."
 project_threshold.501.a: "Begin weapons integration and systems testing"

 project_threshold.511.t: "Operation Sledgehammer"
 project_threshold.511.d: "After months of bitter losses across Eastern Europe and the collapse of the Balkan defensive grid, the European Federation has launched Operation Sledgehammer, a high-risk military offensive to reclaim the Bosphorus Line and reopen the strategic corridor between Europe and the Middle East. Spearheaded by newly deployed HACS units and supported by coordinated artillery, naval, and missiles strikes, the offensive aims to dislodge entrenched CHIMERA swarms from the ruins of Istanbul and its surrounding hills.\n\nThe operation’s success would mark a major turning point in restoring continental mobility and securing Europe’s southern flank. But the swarm’s presence has thickened, and intelligence reports suggest new, previously unseen variants in the region. The battle ahead will be costly."
 project_threshold.511.a: "The dices are cast"

 project_threshold.800.t: "The Zenobia and Saladin Lines are Under Construction"
 project_threshold.800.d: "In response to the rapidly advancing swarm from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle Eastern Defense League has ordered the immediate construction of a fortified barrier across southern Egypt. Dubbed the Zenobia Line, it stretches along the Nile and the western desert flank, integrating reinforced bunkers, trench networks, and long-range artillery positions to halt the CHIMERA’s momentum.\n\nIf Zenobia falls, the Saladin Line awaits behind it. Anchored along the Suez Canal from Port Said to the Red Sea, it stands as the final redoubt, an unbreakable line meant to shield the cultural and spiritual heart of the region from annihilation."
 project_threshold.800.a: "The line is drawn"

 project_threshold.801.t: "Collapse of the Zenobia and Saladin Lines"
 project_threshold.801.d: "Reports are coming through that the CHIMERA swarm has breached both the Zenobia Line in southern Egypt and the Saladin Line along the Suez Canal. Despite brutal defensive efforts and heavy artillery support, the enemy proved too numerous and too relentless.\n\nEntire defensive sectors were overrun, fortifications lost, trench lines consumed, and many units fought to the bitter end. Suez HQ has since then fallen silent. The Middle Eastern Defense League has ordered a full withdrawal toward the Levant.\n\nThe breach of the ultimate defense line opens the gateway to the northern front. There is no buffer left."
 project_threshold.801.a: "They held as long as they could"

 project_threshold.802.t: "Fortifying Europe: The Bosphorus Line"
 project_threshold.802.d: "The Western Coalition has authorized the creation of a new continental redoubt: the Bosphorus Line.\n\nStretching across the straits of Istanbul, this defensive line integrates minefields, naval blockades, prepared positions, and reinforced battlements to prevent a breach into Europe. Stationed at its heart is Task Force Hellespont, a multinational unit ready to fight it out until the end.\n\nThe order is clear: hold the line,no matter the cost."
 project_threshold.802.a: "They won't cross without a fight"

 project_threshold.803.t: "The Fall of the Bosphorus Line"
 project_threshold.803.d: "After a brutal and prolonged siege, the Bosphorus Line has been breached. The CHIMERAs poured through Istanbul in a tide of fire and flesh, overwhelming defenses despite desperate counteroffensive.\n\nTask Force Hellespont fought to the last and are being mourned as heroes of Europe.\n\nWith Europe now directly exposed. The Western world has lost its first shield."
 project_threshold.803.a: "The gatekeepers of Europe will be mourned"

 project_threshold.903.t: "Fall of San Francisco"
 project_threshold.903.d: "San Francisco is gone\n\nThe CHIMERAs emerged through underground fissures and coastal breaches, bypassing defensive lines with terrifying speed. Pacific Command reports all remaining forces have been annihilated or cut off. Civilian losses are catastrophic.\n\nYet another great city lost to the swarm."
 project_threshold.903.a: "The Golden Gate is lost..."

 project_threshold.905.t: "Fall of Shanghai"
 project_threshold.905.d: "Shanghai has fallen.\n\nThe swarm struck in overwhelming force, first through the southern suburbs, then across the Huangpu River, catching the defenders mid-retreat. The Bund became a graveyard of scorched steel and broken concrete. Satellite feeds show nothing but silence now, an empty shell of a city."
 project_threshold.905.a: "When will we stop them?"
