 TNZ_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "After independence was won in 1961, the free Tanganyikan Republic and Zanzibar joined in a union to create the modern state of Tanzania. Under the one party leadership of the first President, Julius Nyerere, the country underwent radical socialist policies. In hindsight it held back economic growth, but succeeded well in bringing about a sense of national unity under a common language: Kiswahili.\n\nUnder the same party Tanzania is now moving in another direction. Privatisation of the economy and a multiparty system gives Tanzania a glim of hope for the next generation."
 TNZ_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "One of Africa's giants, Tanzania still lags behind emerging economies on the continent like South Africa and Nigeria... Until the last decade. Tanzania has promoted political and economic freedom to rapidly industrialize the economy. Now Tanzania enjoys as one of the world's fastest growing economy and all indicators show that it will be so for a while longer. However critics point out the ruling party's inability to crack down on corruption and the frequent harrasments against the opposition parties, leading some to simply put it that the democracy in Tanzania is under attack.  \n \n Tanzania still has a long way to go, so shall Tanzania prosper or will her leaders lead her to despair?"

Many iconic African landmarks spot the countryside that is also  filled with boundless diversity of fauna. It will soon be the 40 year anniversarywhen Julius Nyerere became President of Tanzania and independence was declared from British rule. His  pursuit of socialist "Ujamaa" policies would hinder Tanzanian economic growth but would spare the young republic from disunity and the tribalism that plagues therest of the  continent. Once he stepped down from power ten years ago, his successors would introduce a multi-party system and likewise economic deregulation. Tanzania still attains good ties  with the PRC but is mostly seen as a neutral actor on the world stage.Now with Nyerere wistfully passing away 3 months ago, many Tanzanians look back with nostalgia. But many more  also look into the future for opportunity and hope for change."

 TNZ.13.d: "Relations between Malawi and Tanzania has been frosty at best, and it boils down to the dispute over where the border goes along the lake Malawi. The Tanzanian side claims  that the border runs straight through the middle of the lake. Meanwhile theMalawi's claim that the whole of the lake is theirs that is not Mozambique, including right up to the shore  on the Tanzanian side. \n\nThis goes back to the Heligoland Treaty of 1890 when Germany and Great Britain partitioned the region. The british after WorldWar 1 captured Tanganyika and  put all of the waters of the lake under a single jurisdiction, that of the Malawians. It was later still under colonial times that two jurisdictions were established. Since  independence both sides has been at eachother over thisdispute without being able to produce a settlement. \n\nNow we have yet again put it on the agenda to make justice on the  matter, but many experts are expecting that not much will be achieved and that relations between the two nations will stay the same."

First shots could be heard around 5 a.m. but the local military wasoverwhealmed by the coalition forces with no casualties on the coalition side. Both the airfield and main seaport, nearly all coastal towns fell under occupation by dawn with scenes of jubilation from the local population. By mid-day however the main palace wasdeserted.

The positives would be that we now have  completed a string of bases right through the Indian Ocean, from Australia to DiegoGarcia to the Tanzanian coast. The negatives would be that they ask in return that we guarantee  them in case war would be declared upon them.

The announcement ended with her declaring 14 days of national mourning and ordering all flags to fly half-staff nationwide.\n\nIn the recent weeks, Magufuli's whereabouts hasn't been known to the public. This in effect has led many to speculate on his condition and a few, more sinister conspiracies to grow. There has been especially harsh rhetoric coming from opposition leaders who also early on claimed he was dying.\n\nAt any rate, the Vice-President is now expected to very soon take the oath of office.
