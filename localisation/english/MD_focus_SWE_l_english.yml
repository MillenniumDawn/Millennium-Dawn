 SWE_post_crisis_fiscal_decisions: "Post-Crisis Fiscal Decisions"
 SWE_post_crisis_fiscal_decisions_desc: "The Swedish economy, once equipped with the highest incomes in Europe during the 70s, has not managed to stay ahead of the rest. Especially the Crisis of the 90s, when GDP dropped by 5% at the beginning of the decade, scarred the once untouchable Swedish money machine. The 1994 budget had a deficit of 15% the GDP. Now, the government needs to set a convincing policy for the new millennium."
 SWE_riksbank_policy: "Riksbank Policy"
 SWE_riksbank_policy_desc: "The Sveriges Riksbank is Sweden's central bank, active since 1668 and in charge of managing the Swedish Krona, the national currency. The central bank's actions might be central to the fiscal and even diplomatic stance of the government."
 SWE_currency_policy: "Currency Policy"
 SWE_currency_policy_desc: "Inflation and deflation are always central possibilities to consider. As long as Sweden holds the Krona as its exclusive and very own currency, the Riksbank can control the amount of money in circulation and thus the value of the currency on the national and international markets."
 SWE_improve_the_stridsvagn_122: "Improve the Stridsvagn 122"
 SWE_improve_the_stridsvagn_122_desc: "The Stridsvagn 122 is a licensed version of the German Leopard 2A5 main battle tank. Specialized for forest combat, the Stridsvagn still could be the subject of military experiments to perhaps make the next generation of Swedish tanks an even more effective - and maybe this time less German - family of war machines."
 SWE_contracts_for_german_armament_companies: "Contracts for German Armament Companies"
 SWE_contracts_for_german_armament_companies_desc: "The Swedish military sector has never been massive to begin with and its size has also drained over the decades, especially since the end of the Cold War has put 'armed neutrality' a bit further down on government priorities. While we cannot make sure that our weaponry will be perfect ourselves, the Germans certainly would be happy to. Maybe we should consider hiring them."
 SWE_oresund_bridge: "Öresund Bridge"
 SWE_oresund_bridge_desc: "Under construction since the late 1990s, the Öresundsbron (Danish Øresundsbroen) is a massive bridge-and-tunnel project to connect Malmö in southern Sweden with Copenhagen, capital city of Denmark. This would mark a new connection between southern Fennoscandia and the European mainland and make trade easier with the Danes as well as the Germans and other European countries."
 SWE_expand_e20: "Expand E20"
 SWE_expand_e20_desc: "E20, one of the trans-European roads of the E-road network, connects, among others, Denmark and Sweden over the newly constructed Öresund bridge to then run north towards Stockholm, where the road is continued by ferry towards Estonia and Russia. We should make sure traffic over E20 can run freely; for what helps our partners, helps us."
 SWE_expand_malmo_harbor: "Expand Malmö Harbor"
 SWE_expand_malmo_harbor_desc: "With the Öresund completed, we should also focus on making Malmö a new attractive maritime alternative to Göteborg. This would allow our southern trade partners in Denmark, Germany and Poland to more effectively and more quickly ship goods onto the Swedish mainland."
 SWE_expand_the_merchant_fleet: "Expand the Merchant Fleet"
 SWE_expand_the_merchant_fleet_desc: "With wealth, one should make sure to create the basis for more wealth. By constructing an impressive amount of convoys, we should be able to make sure that Sweden literally stays afloat when it comes to economic competitiveness."
 SWE_expand_the_stockholm_docks: "Expand the Stockholm Docks"
 SWE_expand_the_stockholm_docks_desc: "Our most important window into the eastern Baltic and towards Finland, Estonia and Russia is the port system of our capital system, Stockholm. We should expand it to make trade with these countries easier and less of a hassle."
 SWE_northern_friendship: "Northern Friendship"
 SWE_northern_friendship_desc: "Sweden is a nation of peace and there is no reason to change that. We should focus on building lucrative and cordial relations with our European partners, friends and allies."
 SWE_friendship_with_denmark: "Friendship with Denmark"
 SWE_friendship_with_denmark_desc: "Sweden and Denmark required quite a while to discover their love for each other, going to war more than twenty times over the course of the last ten centuries. But Denmark and Sweden, the former the inspiration of the latter's flag, the latter clearly superior to the former in all the other ways, have found each other as friends and partners. And sometimes rivals. Damn danskjävlar."
 SWE_friendship_with_norway: "Friendship with Norway"
 SWE_friendship_with_norway_desc: "Norway was by Sweden's side for a long time - both figuratively and geographically. But while the weird shape of their country is a tale of it's own, it is undeniable that the friendship of our two nations has been of mutual benefit. Even though they chose divorce in 1905. That was rude."
 SWE_friendship_with_the_baltic_states: "Friendship with the Baltic States"
 SWE_friendship_with_the_baltic_states_desc: "Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania share a lot with the Nordic countries - or so they say. While we still attempt to find out which cultural similarities other than a vague linguistic relationship between the Estonian and Finnish languages is supposed to tie Northern Europe to that part of Eastern Europe, we might as well make them our friends already. Why not?"
 SWE_swedish_norwegian_steel_production: "Swedish-Norwegian Steel Production"
 SWE_swedish_norwegian_steel_production_desc: "The borderlands of Sweden and Norway are both rich in natural resources and hard to reach. Maybe, by working together, our two countries can find common ground to stand on. And other, divided, ground that we can mine and sell to the highest bidder."
 SWE_friendship_with_finland: "Friendship with Finland"
 SWE_friendship_with_finland_desc: "Finland has been our loyal neighbor since their independence. And while they wouldn't make the same claims regarding our loyalty after the debacle of the Winter War, our nations are generally on somewhat good terms, especially considering that Finland-Swedes are an important minority that the two nations need to somewhat take care of together."
 SWE_job_opportunities_in_scania: "Job Opportunities in Scania"
 SWE_job_opportunities_in_scania_desc: "With foreign people and businesses alike flocking into southern Sweden, we can afford to sponsor the creation of jobs in this region. More customers means more demand, which means more potential for growth."
 SWE_friendship_with_iceland: "Friendship with Iceland"
 SWE_friendship_with_iceland_desc: "Iceland is a sight to behold and diplomatically the perhaps least controversial country on earth. Not being Iceland's friend is pretty much a sin."
 SWE_expand_e6: "Expand E6"
 SWE_expand_e6_desc: "E6, which leads all the way from northern Norway down to Oslo and from there to the southern tip of Sweden, is one of the most important trade and travel routes between Sweden and its oil-loving, super rich western neighbor. We should cherish the Norwego-Swedish relationship and the trade dynamic of our two nations by keeping the road intact and making it more accessible on our side."
 SWE_further_european_integration: "Further European Integration"
 SWE_further_european_integration_desc: "While Sweden is skeptical of pan-European ideas just from a cultural standpoint, further economic integration has proven undeniably effective. The Germans are buying our stuff and we are buying German stuff. The Danish are buying our stuff and we are buying Danish stuff. Let's sell and buy more stuff."
 SWE_reform_the_diplomatic_agenda: "Reform the Diplomatic Agenda"
 SWE_reform_the_diplomatic_agenda_desc: "The world stage is a very precarious area of affairs and a single misstep can cost thousands of jobs or even millions of lives. We need to make sure Sweden only uses the best of the best when it comes to ambassadors, serving Swedish interests with determination but not so openly as to offend our partners."
 SWE_invite_european_experts: "Invite European Experts"
 SWE_invite_european_experts_desc: "Our European Partners have the personnel needed to solve almost any problem we might face. By inviting them and gathering them in Stockholm, we could gain a new resource of knowledge to draw from."
 SWE_befriend_germany: "Befriend Germany"
 SWE_befriend_germany_desc: "Germany is Sweden's most important destination of exports and the most important origin of imports. To offend the Germans would mean jeopardizing our entire economy."

 SWE_european_military_contracts: "European Military Contracts"

 SWE_armored_initiative_desc: "Armored Warfare is faster and stronger than regular infantry, let's make the swedish Blitzkrieg!"
 SWE_artillery_initiative: "Artillery Initiative"
 SWE_artillery_initiative_desc: "Artillery is very important in the cold north, since soldiers can freeze."
 SWE_infantry_weapons_initiative: "Infantry Weapons Initiative"
 SWE_infantry_weapons_initiative_desc: "Infantry may not be the best option, since it's not fast and we don't have a lot of men to recruit, but we cannot ignore that it forms the backbone of any army."
 SWE_befriend_the_united_kingdom: "Befriend the United Kingdom"
 SWE_befriend_the_united_kingdom_desc: "The UK is a great country, one of the biggest industrial and military powers inside the EU. Let's befriend them and profit."

 SWE_northern_ambition: "Northern Ambition"
 SWE_northern_ambition_desc: "Sweden has preserved neutrality for the past two centuries. It is time to end this regrettable trend and to finally put our foot down on a world stage that has for too long ignored us."
 SWE_northern_nationalism: "Northern Nationalism"
 SWE_northern_nationalism_desc: "Perhaps, our neighbors are not as puny as one might anticipate when looking at how their flags are generally just inferior versions of ours. Forming a united identity and a united nationalistic fervor, directed against the rest of world, might make our dreams forged by alcohol become a reality forged by blood."
 SWE_justify_swedish_imperialism: "Justify Swedish Imperialism"
 SWE_justify_swedish_imperialism_desc: "Generally, the Swedish colonial endeavors of old are seen as laughable footnotes of history in the modern times. Sweden holding Estonia and Danzig? Colonizing in North America? How silly, right? No longer! These attempts at realizing a Swedish empire under a Swedish sovereign have to be not our subject of ridicule, but our subject of admiration."
 SWE_partnership_of_convenience: "Partnership of Convenience"
 SWE_partnership_of_convenience_desc: "Russia can be our friends very easily, since we both live in cold desolate forests."
 SWE_join_csto: "Join CSTO"
 SWE_join_csto_desc: "In order to find a new position within world politics, we have turned away from our former western partners. Thankfully, there is another isolated authoritarian giant vying for world power close by. Allying the Russians is the next logical step for Swedish greatness."
 SWE_animosity_towards_russia: "Animosity towards Russia"
 SWE_animosity_towards_russia_desc: "We could regain lost popular trust by assuring the Swedish population that we will certainly not draw towards the authoritarians of the east. Russia is not Sweden's friend."

 SWE_rediscover_racial_theories: "Rediscover Racial Theories"
 SWE_rediscover_racial_theories_desc: "Sweden used to be one of the original racists, biological theories about the implications of heritage included. Good times. By welcoming these educative doctrines back into our school, we might just revive a good part of Swedish society."
 SWE_glorify_the_royal_family: "Glorify the Royal Family"
 SWE_glorify_the_royal_family_desc: "The Swedish royal family never did anything wrong and are always correct. They are the best royal family in all of Europe!"

 SWE_declare_the_finns_honorary_northeners_desc: "Just like one of the fine men of history that we look up to did in November of 1942, we should recognize that the Finnish people are actually part of the master race. These mongoloids can be useful for something after all."

 SWE_the_emperor_of_sweden: "The Emperor of Sweden"
 SWE_the_emperor_of_sweden_desc: "Being a king is good and all, but you know what's better? Being an emperor. 'King of Sweden' sounds like a boring head of state of a boring constitutional monarchy. But 'Emperor of Sweden' sounds like a ruler that is going to make Sweden great again, make Estonia a colony again and make the King of Belgium look like an idiot."
 SWE_northern_militias: "Northern Militias"

 Sweden.1.t: "The End of the State Church of Sweden"
 Sweden.1.d: "The Church of Sweden is the largest Christian church community in Sweden and the second largest Lutheran community in the world as well as the third-largest protestant church, smaller only than Ethiopia's Lutheran Mekane Yesus and the UK's Anglican Church of England.\n\nThe tight connection between state and the Church of Sweden has been constantly called into question recently, with the Church of Sweden designated the state church of the Swedish government and monarchy. Many other European nations do not give such a position to a particular church body. This, in the eyes of critics, does not only discriminate against foreigners of non-Christian belief, but also the small catholic and orthodox communities of Sweden.\n\nThere is no real power held by the Church of Sweden anymore. Should we not abolish our ties to them? Or stick to them for the sake of tradition?\n\nHistorically, Sweden cut its ties to its state church on January 1st, 2000."
 Sweden.1.o1: "We need to get rid of it!"
 Sweden.1.o2: "Lutheranism is important! Keep it!"
 Sweden.1.o3: "Thor and Odin are far better anyway."
 Sweden.3.t: "The End of the State Church of Sweden"
 Sweden.3.d: "The Church of Sweden is the largest christian church community in Sweden and the second largest Lutheran community in the world as well as the third-largest protestant church, smaller only than Ethiopia's Lutheran Mekane Yesus and the UK's Anglican Church of England.\n\nThe tight connection between state and the Church of Sweden has been constantly called into question recently, with the Church of Sweden designated the state church of the Swedish government and monarchy.

 Sweden.3.o1: "We need to get rid of it!"
 Sweden.3.o2: "Lutheranism is important! Keep it!"
 Sweden.3.o3: "Thor and Odin are far better anyway."
 Sweden.4.t: "Rise of Daniel"
 Sweden.4.d: "Neutral [Root.GetName] has been laughed at for its apparent cowardice since a few centuries. Never would have anyone predicted that the most genius general of not only contemporary military strategy but also all of human history would be raised and trained in Sweden.\n\nDaniel Sjöberg, often simply called \"Da9L\" inside military circles (nobody quite knows why), is possibly the greatest military genius of all time - a man that even outshadows Hannibal, Napoleon Bonaparte and D.D.R. Jake 'the Scot'."
 Sweden.4.o1: "Daniel will lead us to victory!"
 Sweden.5.t: "Post-Crisis Fiscal Decisions"
 Sweden.5.d: "The budgetary and economic crises of the 1990s have left Sweden scarred. Our spending is far exceeding our income and we need to do something."
 Sweden.5.o1: "Welfare cuts are the only choice."
 Sweden.5.o2: "The deficit is inevitable."
 Sweden.6.t: "Riksbank Policy"
 Sweden.6.d: "The central bank of Sweden is primarily tasked with managing the currency, the Swedish Krona, and thus managing inflation and deflation of monetary values in the Swedish economy. The Riksbank needs new orders as to how to proceed over the next few years."
 Sweden.6.o1: "Keep the economy stable."
 Sweden.6.o2: "Inflate the Krona."
 Sweden.7.t: "Pro-Swedish Video Games"
 Sweden.7.d: "Video games are an easy way to influence stupid people who spend more time playing political video games instead of focusing on real issues.\n\nWhat project should we push forwards to completion? (We have already excluded a game set between 1836 and 1936, because that will not happen.)\n\nRemember, we need to teach the kids about how great Sweden is. Also, we need to lock essential gameplay features behind paywalls."
 Sweden.7.o1: "'Ironhearts'. a game about neutrality.."
 Sweden.7.o2: "'Europa Supremalis', a game about enslaving Africans."
 Sweden.7.o3: "'Deus Vult', a game about incest."
 Sweden.8.t: "Sweden demands Equality for Finland-Swedes"
 Sweden.8.d: "Sweden's recent neo-imperialistic aggression against Finland has peaked in demands for equality for the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland.\n\nHere is the thing: They are already equal. The biggest movement within the group claiming otherwise has gathered 50 members so far. There is nothing the Swedes could possibly be offended about - and nothing we can change."
 Sweden.8.o1: "The Swedes are insane."
 Sweden.9.t: "Baltic Colonization Plan"
 Sweden.9.d: "The Baltic States need to return to Swedish dependency status. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were acceptable temporary solutions - but their time is at an end."
 Sweden.9.o1: "For Sweden!"
 Sweden.10.t: "Sweden offers us provincial status"
 Sweden.10.d: "Sure, we always liked the idea of being part of northern Europe, but Sweden has been very... open with us recently. And now, the Swedish royal government has called upon Estonia to join Sweden as a province. This would result in the end of Estonia as a sovereign nation. How preposterous."
 Sweden.10.o1: "We have to fold."
 Sweden.10.o2: "Never!"
 Sweden.11.t: "Estonia resists!"
 Sweden.11.d: "Estonia has dared to reject our generous proposal of taking the burden of guiding the Estonians towards civilization. We were surprised they managed to make their answer letter be free of grammatical errors - but we are also skeptical of what comes next. How should we proceed?"
 Sweden.11.o1: "They misunderstood when they thought there was a choice."
 Sweden.11.o2: "Oh well. We will get them another time."
# Sweden_news.1.t: "Northern Ambition"
# Sweden_news.1.d: "Sweden is taking steps to turn away from its neutral foreign policy doctrines. Whether that will remain in a more active Swedish role in international peacekeeping or a more decisive role in starting local military conflicts still has to be seen however."

Still, it was simulated as part of a war game. A carrier task force with numerous antisubmarine escorts faced off against HSwMS Gotland, a small Swedish diesel-powered submarine weighing 1,600 tons. Despite multiple attacks on Reagan, the Gotland was never detected. US Navy has requested a leased of the Gotland and its crew for two years to conduct antisubmarine exercises.

On 23 October 2002, the Svea Court of Appeal in Stockholm found four young men jointly guilty of the murder.

At the time, she was not protected by bodyguards from the Swedish Security Service; this proved controversial, given the similarity between Lindh's murder and that of Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986 (the first murder of a government member in modern Swedish history)."
 Sweden.27.o1: "Oh no"
 Sweden.27.o2: "We will find who did this!"
 
 Sweden.28.t: "The Police found the murderer!"
 Sweden.28.d: "A man was apprehended on 16 September and detained as a suspect on 'justifiable grounds' (the lowest level of suspicion), but was cleared of all charges and released. On 24 September, the police announced that a suspect, Mijailo Mijailović (born in Sweden to Serb parents), had been apprehended and arrested at a higher level of suspicion: 'probable cause'. On 25 September, it was announced that Mijailović's DNA profile matched that of hairs on a baseball cap left at (or near) the scene of the crime, and he resembled the man filmed in the store where Lindh was attacked. After denying all involvement Mijailović confessed to the crime on 6 January 2004, providing a full account of the events of 10 September in an extra session of police questioning requested by Peter Althin (Mijailović's counsel). He was found guilty in a trial held from 14 to 17 January. After a psychiatric evaluation he was sentenced to life imprisonment on 23 March. On 8 July, an appeals court overturned Mijailović's sentence (after tests concluded he was mentally ill at the time of the murder), and Mijailović was transferred to a secure psychiatric ward. Prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court of Sweden, which reinstated his sentence to life imprisonment on 2 December of that year. Mijailović renounced his Swedish citizenship, and has unsuccessfully requested to be transferred to Serbia."
 Sweden.28.o1: "We got him"

 Sweden_foci.10.t: "Strategic Integration: The Infrastructure Imperative"
 Sweden_foci.10.d: "In an increasingly volatile world, infrastructure is no longer merely a matter of civil planning. Railways, digital grids, ports, and transport corridors have become essential components of military readiness and strategic mobility. Sweden has formally proposed a joint European initiative to modernize and interconnect critical infrastructure across the continent, with a dual-use design for both economic resilience and defense utility.\n\nThe proposal, backed by Swedish defense planners and the Ministry of Enterprise, outlines a coordinated effort to expand logistics capacity, standardize military mobility protocols, and fortify critical nodes against sabotage or cyberattack. It emphasizes the need to secure trans-Baltic connections, enhance NATO operational flow from the Arctic to Central Europe, and enable rapid deployment scenarios in case of hybrid or conventional threats.\n\nWhile framed as a contribution to EU economic cohesion and green transition goals, the underlying logic is unmistakably strategic. Sweden seeks to position itself not only as a logistic hub, but as a proactive shaper of Europe’s geoeconomic and defense architecture.\n\nThe response from key European partners will define whether this initiative marks a turning point in collective resilience or falls victim to fragmented national interests and political inertia."
 Sweden_foci.10.a: "Approve the proposal, Europe must be ready."
 Sweden_foci.10.b: "Reject, this goes beyond civil infrastructure."
 Sweden_foci.101.t: "[ROOT.GetNamewithFlag] Joins the Infrastructure Initiative"
 Sweden_foci.101.d: "[FROM.GetNamewithFlag] has officially committed to participating in our pan-European infrastructure initiative. By doing so, they recognize that roads, ports, and rail lines are not just economic lifelines, but strategic assets in an age of growing uncertainty. Their leadership has acknowledged that civil and military logistics must be harmonized across Europe to ensure rapid response, secure supply chains, and regional resilience.\n\nThis decision strengthens the ability of both our countries to withstand and adapt to military pressure, while also boosting trade and transnational cooperation. Behind the scenes, military planners are already coordinating on joint logistics protocols, cyber-resilience measures, and contingency mobility routes.\n\nTheir participation sends a powerful message: Europe will not be caught off guard. Unity in infrastructure is unity in defense."
 Sweden_foci.101.a: "A wise decision."
 Sweden_foci.102.t: "[ROOT.GetNamewithFlag]§! Rejects Our Proposal"
 Sweden_foci.102.d: "§Y[FROM.GetNamewithFlag]§! has declined our offer to join the strategic infrastructure initiative, citing sovereignty concerns, budgetary limitations, or divergent priorities. While the decision is framed as pragmatic, it ultimately signals a reluctance to invest in long-term resilience and mutual defense capacity.\n\nIn the current security climate, such isolationist thinking carries risks. Without integrated logistics, rapid force deployment becomes uncertain. Without shared standards, supply chains remain vulnerable. And without political will, Europe’s collective deterrence weakens.\n\nThough regrettable, we will press ahead with willing partners. Should a military crisis arise, they may find that the cost of inaction outweighs any short-term savings. Infrastructure is not a luxury it is the scaffolding of sovereignty."
 Sweden_foci.102.a: "Their loss."
 Sweden_foci.11.t: "§Y[SWE.GetNamewithFlag] Offers to Join the Cybershield Initiative"
 Sweden_foci.11.d: "In today’s world, war is no longer confined to the battlefield or conventional weapons. Conflicts have evolved silent, elegant, and often invisible to the public eye. Cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, digital sabotage, and AI-driven influence operations now pose threats not only to military structures but to every citizen, institution, and enterprise.\n\n§Y[SWE.GetNamewithFlag]§! has presented us with the opportunity to join the Cybershield Initiative a multinational cooperation framework aimed at building collective cyber resilience. The program includes joint monitoring centers, shared threat intelligence, and coordinated responses to hostile intrusions and hybrid warfare tactics.\n\nAs the digitalization of our society deepens with each passing year, the cyber domain is becoming one of the most decisive arenas of national security. Joining would enhance our capabilities and embed us in a larger defense network. However, accepting the offer also implies a degree of technological alignment and shared sovereignty in digital matters."
 Sweden_foci.11.a: "We will join, united we are safer."
 Sweden_foci.11.b: "We stand alone, our strength is independence."
 Sweden_foci.111.t: "[ROOT.GetNamewithFlag] Joins the Cybershield Initiative"
 Sweden_foci.111.d: "§Y[ROOT.GetNamewithFlag]§! has officially agreed to participate in our Cybershield initiative. Their decision marks a critical step toward building a pan-European digital defense architecture, where trusted partners share intelligence, reinforce their civilian and military cyber resilience, and stand united against hybrid threats.\n\nAs part of the integration process, joint protocols will be established for threat detection, critical infrastructure protection, and rapid response capabilities. This cooperation is expected to significantly boost both our operational awareness and our ability to withstand complex, multilayered cyber offensives.\n\nTheir commitment strengthens not just our digital frontier it affirms a shared vision of sovereignty and strategic autonomy in the 21st century."
 Sweden_foci.111.a: "Excellent, unity in cyberspace."
 Sweden_foci.112.t: "[ROOT.GetNamewithFlag] Rejects the Cybershield Initiative"
 Sweden_foci.112.d: "§Y[ROOT.GetNamewithFlag]§! has declined our invitation to join the Cybershield initiative. Whether motivated by skepticism, political calculation, or a desire for digital non-alignment, their decision sends a signal that they are unwilling to embed themselves in a collective cybersecurity framework.\n\nThis rejection not only weakens the potential scope of information-sharing and digital deterrence across Europe, but may also isolate §Y[ROOT.GetNamewithFlag]§! in an era when disinformation, sabotage, and hostile code respect no borders.\n\nWhile disappointing, their absence will not halt our efforts. We will proceed with those who understand the stakes and are willing to act accordingly."
 Sweden_foci.112.a: "A short-sighted move."
 Sweden_foci.12.t: "Sweden Proposes a Mutual Economic Forum"
 Sweden_foci.12.d: "In a move aimed at strengthening regional cooperation and industrial resilience, §Y[SWE.GetNameWithFlag]§! has proposed the creation of a mutual economic forum. The idea is to institutionalize economic dialogue, investment coordination, and long-term industrial partnerships between participating states.\n\nSweden argues that deepening economic ties especially in sectors like green technology, advanced manufacturing, and digital innovation would not only stabilize growth but also reinforce strategic autonomy in an increasingly polarized global economy. Joint procurement programs, supply chain protection mechanisms, and shared innovation funds are among the proposed instruments.\n\nParticipation in this forum would come with access to shared research, greater integration of industrial strategies, and the potential for long-term competitiveness on a continental scale.\n\nThe question now is: do we wish to shape this new architecture, or remain outside of it?"
 Sweden_foci.12.a: "An excellent initiative we will join."
 Sweden_foci.12.b: "We are not interested."
 Sweden_foci.121.t: "[ROOT.GetNamewithFlag] Joins the Economic Forum"
 Sweden_foci.121.d: "§Y[ROOT.GetNamewithFlag]§! has accepted our proposal to establish a mutual economic forum. Their decision marks a positive step toward greater coordination of industrial policy, regional supply chain resilience, and innovation-driven growth.\n\nInitial bilateral talks are already underway, exploring cooperation in areas such as energy systems, digital markets, and green transition technologies. This alliance could become a blueprint for pragmatic, self-sufficient economic development in an era of shifting global trade dynamics.\n\nSweden’s initiative is gaining traction and with each new participant, its potential multiplies."
 Sweden_foci.121.a: "A promising partnership."
 Sweden_foci.122.t: "[ROOT.GetNamewithFlag] Declines the Economic Forum Invitation"
 Sweden_foci.122.d: "§Y[ROOT.GetNamewithFlag]§! has decided not to participate in the proposed mutual economic forum. Whether out of concern for sovereignty, misalignment of priorities, or reluctance to coordinate economic strategies, the rejection limits the scope of what could have been a powerful regional framework.\n\nThough regrettable, Sweden will proceed with like-minded partners. The forum's goal remains unchanged: to create a resilient, cooperative economic architecture fit for an uncertain future.\n\nIf circumstances shift, the door may still be open but momentum may be hard to recover."
 Sweden_foci.122.a: "Their decision, their consequences."
 Sweden_foci.13.t: "Sweden Proposes Strategic Think Tank Cooperation"
 Sweden_foci.13.d: "§Y[SWE.GetNameWithFlag]§! has reached out with a proposal to intensify cooperation between our leading think tanks, academic institutions, and policy advisory bodies. The goal is to align strategic outlooks, coordinate long-term policy research, and build a shared knowledge infrastructure capable of anticipating geopolitical shifts and hybrid threats.\n\nSuch cooperation would include regular policy dialogues, shared scenario planning, joint publications, and expert exchange programs. Sweden believes that by pooling intellectual capital, our countries can sharpen their strategic foresight and better prepare for emerging challenges in defense, technology, energy security, and economic resilience.\n\nWhile the forum would remain independent of direct political control, its influence on policymaking could be significant. The question is: are we ready to think together, or will we continue to reason in isolation?"
 Sweden_foci.13.a: "Knowledge is power – we will join."
 Sweden_foci.13.b: "We prefer to maintain full autonomy."
 Sweden_foci.131.t: "[ROOT.GetNameWithFlag] Joins the Strategic Think Tank Network"
 Sweden_foci.131.d: "§Y[ROOT.GetNameWithFlag]§! has accepted our invitation to build a cooperative network of research institutions, strategic studies centers, and policy advisory think tanks. This new layer of collaboration opens a backchannel of structured intellectual exchange, capable of shaping national strategies and building resilience against disinformation, cognitive warfare, and policy fragmentation.\n\nThe first joint symposium is already in planning. Topics include digital sovereignty, military-civil fusion, energy transitions, and the impact of emerging technologies on national security.\n\nThis is more than just academic outreach it’s strategic alignment through ideas."
 Sweden_foci.131.a: "An intelligent choice."
 Sweden_foci.132.t: "[ROOT.GetNameWithFlag] Declines Strategic Think Tank Cooperation"
 Sweden_foci.132.d: "§Y[ROOT.GetNameWithFlag]§! has chosen not to engage in Sweden’s proposed network for deeper think tank cooperation. Whether due to ideological distance, concerns about influence, or a preference for national intellectual autonomy, their refusal narrows the scope of cross-border strategic dialogue.\n\nWhile regrettable, the initiative will proceed with willing participants. In a time when information is a battlefield and insight is a weapon, choosing isolation over cooperation may come at a cost.\n\nThe conversation will continue with or without them."
 Sweden_foci.132.a: "Let them miss the future."
 Sweden_foci.14.t: "Sweden Invites Us to a Joint Military Exercise"
 Sweden_foci.14.d: "§Y[SWE.GetNameWithFlag]§! has extended an invitation to participate in a coordinated military exercise on Swedish territory. The drills are expected to simulate multi-domain defense scenarios, including coastal protection, cyber warfare resilience, and rapid deployment of mixed NATO-standard and national units.\n\nBeyond the operational benefits, this is also a diplomatic signal. Sweden is showing itself as a credible security partner and is testing both its own readiness and that of its allies under realistic conditions. The exercise provides us with an opportunity to assess Swedish capabilities, refine our interoperability, and strengthen mutual trust.\n\nJoint military exercises serve as both deterrence and preparation. Whether we choose to join will send a message of its own."
 Sweden_foci.14.a: "We will participate – joint strength is real strength."
 Sweden_foci.14.b: "We decline – our doctrine remains sovereign."
 Sweden_foci.141.t: "[ROOT.GetNameWithFlag] Joins the Swedish Military Exercise"
 Sweden_foci.141.d: "§Y[ROOT.GetNameWithFlag]§! has accepted our invitation to join the upcoming joint military drills. Their participation increases the scope and complexity of the exercise, adding valuable interoperability testing between command structures, logistics systems, and real-time coordination protocols.\n\nObservers from allied states and defense attachés from third countries are expected to monitor the event closely. This cooperation visibly strengthens regional security and showcases Sweden’s increasing role as a capable and reliable defense actor.\n\nTrust is built in action and this exercise will speak louder than words."
 Sweden_foci.141.a: "A strong signal to potential adversaries."
 Sweden_foci.142.t: "[ROOT.GetNameWithFlag] Declines the Military Exercise Invitation"
 Sweden_foci.142.d: "§Y[ROOT.GetNameWithFlag]§! has declined to join our planned military drills. While they have not issued an official reason, the decision may stem from political caution, logistical concerns, or a reluctance to be seen aligning too closely with Swedish or NATO defense postures.\n\nThis absence may be noted by both allies and adversaries alike. In times of uncertainty, the willingness or unwillingness to train together says much about a nation’s strategic orientation.\n\nNonetheless, the exercises will go forward. Those who show up, shape the future."
 Sweden_foci.142.a: "They chose silence over solidarity."
 Sweden_foci.143.t: "The NATO–Swedish Exercise Begins in Norrbotten"
 Sweden_foci.143.d: "Boden, in the remote expanse of Norrbottens län, has become the epicenter of one of the most ambitious military exercises ever held on Swedish soil. Normally better known for reindeer herding, snow-covered silence, and the occasional shout of 'Perkele!' echoing from across the Finnish border, this quiet northern region now hums with the coordinated movements of tanks, aircraft, and special forces.\n\nThe joint Swedish–NATO drill brings together a range of modern capabilities: Gripen and Eurofighter squadrons duel in the skies, multiple Leopard variants thunder across frozen terrain, and elite troops conduct simulated amphibious landings on the icy edges of Buddbyträsket.\n\nBeyond military spectacle, this exercise is a signal strategic readiness, allied interoperability, and the Swedish doctrine of total defense made tangible. Civilian preparedness and military professionalism are not opposing values here they are two sides of the same coin.\n\n§YCivis pacem, para bellum§! is not just Latin rhetoric. It is a principle woven into the Nordic way of thinking silent, focused, and enduring."
 Sweden_foci.143.a: "A cold rehearsal for a warmer world."

But strength comes in many forms.\n\nIn one camp, the voices are clear: purchase new STRV 122 tanks and CV 90 infantry fighting vehicles. Proven tools, familiar to our soldiers, ready to be deployed in the forests and fields they were made for.\n\nOthers urge caution. Why spend now, they ask, when the world of tomorrow will demand new systems and smarter designs? Better to invest in development engineers, labs, and ideas that may shape the next generation of Swedish defence.\n\nThen there are those who see numbers. Cold, fiscal limits. They point at the spreadsheets in Finansdepartementet and shake their heads. The will may be there, but the money is not.\n\nThe Riksdag must decide once more."

They see future threats not in dogfights, but in systems stealth, sensors, precision. Funds, they say, should go to development, not deployment.\n\nBut in the quiet rooms of the Finance Ministry, the mood is more sober. Enthusiasm meets budget ceilings. Patriotism meets accounting.\n\nOnce again, the government must choose."

A full-spectrum modernization to make Totalförsvaret more than a doctrine: a reality.\n\nOthers suggest patience. Better to invest in future designs lighter, smarter, more efficient. We must not build for today what will be outdated tomorrow.\n\nAnd then, of course, reality knocks. There are spreadsheets, limits, promises made elsewhere. Ambition meets austerity. The coffers are not bottomless.\n\nNow we decide what strength looks like."

The Försvarsutskottet presents its findings, and the room is filled with nods, furrowed brows, and the untranslatable art of measured Swedish compromise.\n\nOutside the capital, the mood is different. In Boden and Revingehed, officers wonder if their regiments will survive another round of cuts. The conscript barracks feel emptier than they should. Across the country, people read the headlines and sigh. It is, after all, a very Swedish thing to debate security policy with a spreadsheet in one hand and a principle of neutrality in the other.\n\nThe new Försvarsbeslutet proposes reduced expenditures, consolidation of units, and a downsizing of the standing forces. Critics warn of a weakening posture in an unpredictable world. Supporters call it fiscal responsibility in a time of peace. As always, the final result is a compromise.\n\nWe are not disarming. But we are shrinking quietly, politely, and with great concern for process.\n\nTotalförsvaret remains on paper. Whether it remains in practice… will depend on what the future demands."

Units wonder when their budgets will change. Municipalities glance at infrastructure plans. Some are ready to move others would prefer another round of quiet discussions.\n\nThis is the Swedish way. Calm, measured, deliberate. No one yells. No one panics. But everyone knows: Totalförsvaret only works if the machinery is well-oiled and the gears turn in sync.\n\nNow comes the matter of timing. Not if but when."

 Sweden_news.6.t: "Forging Leaders for the Front"
 Sweden_news.6.d: "In classrooms and on live-fire ranges, Sweden’s future commanders are being shaped. Tactical theory gives way to smoke drills and sand-table exercises; the pressure of decisions made in minutes hardens instinct into doctrine.\n\nFrom Försvarshögskolan to remote battalion posts, officers hone the skill that separates order from chaos. In Totalförsvaret, leadership is not optional it is the linchpin of survival.\n\nWe do not wait for war to teach us. We prepare in advance."
 Sweden_news.6.o1: "A sharp mind leads steady hands."
 Sweden_news.7.t: "The People in Uniform"
 Sweden_news.7.d: "They arrive in faded camouflage, carrying standard-issue rifles and thermoses from home. They are teachers, mechanics, students citizens. But this week, they are Hemvärnet.\n\nAcross forests and farmlands, home defence exercises unfold with startling realism. Roadblocks go up overnight. Communications are tested in blackout conditions. Field kitchens feed battalions. Children watch from porches as convoys pass.\n\nThis is not the military coming to the people. It is the people becoming the military."
 Sweden_news.7.o1: "Prepared in peace, ready in crisis."
 Sweden_news.8.t: "The March Home Begins"
 Sweden_news.8.d: "The helmets come off. Checkpoints vanish. Roads once patrolled by armoured vehicles now host bicycles and summer traffic. The mobilized units of Hemvärnet stand down, leaving behind little but ruts in the soil and a memory of movement.\n\nYet something lingers. In every village that hosted a platoon, in every forest cleared for training, there is a subtle shift. We returned to normal but normal now knows what preparation feels like.\n\nTotalförsvaret taught us that security is not the absence of fear. It is the presence of readiness."
 Sweden_news.8.o1: "Normal, but never naive again."
 Sweden_news.9.t: "A Nation Called to Readiness"
 Sweden_news.9.d: "The activation order came just after dawn. Within hours, uniforms were unpacked, weapons collected, radios crackled to life. In towns and outposts across Sweden, the quiet machinery of mobilisation began to hum.\n\nHemvärnet doesn’t arrive with ceremony it simply appears. Road intersections are secured. Communications hubs are manned. The forests whisper again with movement.\n\nThere is no panic. Only determination. The country has trained for this moment. Now, it enacts it."
 Sweden_news.9.o1: "Ordinary people. Extraordinary readiness."
 Sweden_news.10.t: "Försvarsbeslutet 2000 Comes Into Force"
 Sweden_news.10.d: "The new structure is in place. Across the country, columns of armored vehicles glide through quiet towns, headed toward their restructured garrisons. Children watch in awe as steel giants roll past their schools, their imaginations stirred by the rumble of readiness.\n\nIn Boden, Skövde, and Enköping, life begins to shift. Young women lean against fences, watching the arrival of conscripts from every corner of the country faces new to the north, drawn by duty. There’s a familiar sparkle in the eyes, a nod to tradition, to the slow rhythms of shared service.\n\nThe number of units has changed. The map of Sweden's defence is redrawn. But the essence remains: people, purpose, and preparedness. *Totalförsvaret* has not disappeared. It has simply moved to fewer, stronger foundations."
 Sweden_news.10.a: "A new Millennia has begun"
 Sweden_news.11.t: "Continuity in a Changing World"
 Sweden_news.11.d: "While a few weary-eyed budget analysts in the Ministry of Finance are visibly displeased with the decision to maintain such a sizeable armed force, not everyone shares their concern. In Boden, a group of young conscripts now with a real path toward professional service break into a spontaneous performance of *Dancing Queen* in the snow-covered courtyard. It’s an oddly touching scene, part satire, part pride. An uncommon emotional moment ripples through the nation.\n\nEven His Majesty the King, usually reserved in matters of state, pens a handwritten letter to the Riksdag thanking its members for their wisdom and for preserving a tradition that has long stood as a pillar of Swedish independence."
 Sweden_news.11.a: "A structure worth defending."
 Sweden_news.12.t: "Swedish National Fund to Invest in Cryptocurrency"
 Sweden_news.12.d: "While Sweden has never been known for bold moves in monetary policy, the pace of global financial innovation has made hesitation a risk in itself. Today, in a historic announcement, the King declared that the national retirement fund will be authorized to expand its portfolio by investing directly in cryptocurrencies   and even into cryptocurrency mining operations.\n\nSupporters hail the decision as visionary and necessary for future-proofing Sweden’s economy, while critics warn of the volatility and uncertainty that still surround digital assets.\n\nNevertheless, the age of crypto has officially reached Sweden’s financial heart."
 Sweden_news.12.a: "A bold step into the future."

 Sweden_news.20.t: "Agenda: \"The Price of Neutrality\""
 Sweden_news.20.d: "In its latest broadcast, Agenda tackled 'The Price of Neutrality'. Economists, former diplomats, and military officials debated the tangible costs and benefits of Sweden’s non-aligned stance. \"We forgo influence, but keep independence,\" said one expert. Others noted lost opportunities in security cooperation and arms development. The show underscored a hard truth: while neutrality offers freedom, it often comes at the expense of leverage, access, and assurance. As the world grows more volatile, the old model faces new questions."
 Sweden_news.20.a: "The cost of principle is rarely cheap."
 Sweden_news.21.t: "Agenda: \"Ask the Minister – A Public Dialogue on Defense\""
 Sweden_news.21.d: "Agenda aired a live segment titled 'Ask the Minister', where citizens questioned Sweden’s Minister of Defence directly. Topics ranged from military spending to strategic partnerships. When asked about neutrality, the Minister responded: \"Our policy adapts to the world, but our principles remain.\" While some praised the openness, others called the answers evasive. Viewers were left pondering whether this was meaningful dialogue or polished public relations. One thing was certain: public trust must be earned, not managed."
 Sweden_news.21.a: "The people are watching and judging."
 Sweden_news.22.t: "Agenda: \"Security Awareness or Quiet Mobilization?\""
 Sweden_news.22.d: "In an episode titled 'Security Awareness or Quiet Mobilization?', Agenda addressed the fine line between information and alarm. With government leaflets and PSAs on the rise, panelists debated whether this reflects transparency or subtle militarization. \"We’re being asked to prepare but for what exactly?\" asked a communications professor. Others argued that democratic nations must foster civilian readiness without fear. The episode captured a growing unease: is Sweden preparing for war or just preparing the public mind?"
 Sweden_news.22.a: "The message is clear but the motive is not."
 Sweden_news.23.t: "Agenda: \"A Symbolic Campaign to Prepare the Citizens?\""
 Sweden_news.23.d: "Agenda investigated a recent public campaign launched by Swedish authorities to raise awareness of civil defense and national security. Titled 'A Symbolic Campaign to Prepare the Citizens?', the segment questioned whether the initiative has substance or simply symbolic intent. \"It looks more like theatre than preparedness,\" said one guest. Others defended the program as a necessary first step toward building public resilience. The show captured a society in quiet tension aware of growing risks, unsure how to respond."
 Sweden_news.23.a: "Public readiness remains more aspiration than fact."
 Sweden_news.24.t: "Agenda: \"The Swedish Way – Between Idealism and Realpolitik\""
 Sweden_news.24.d: "In a thoughtful discussion titled 'The Swedish Way', Agenda explored whether Sweden’s moral diplomacy still aligns with its foreign policy behavior. \"We claim to lead with values,\" said one journalist, \"but our arms exports and alliance strategies suggest otherwise.\" The debate touched on everything from UN peacekeeping to military-industrial deals. The segment closed with a provocative question: Is 'the Swedish way' a guiding principle or just a branding exercise in a cynical world?"
 Sweden_news.24.a: "The myth of moral exceptionalism meets scrutiny."
 Sweden_news.25.t: "Agenda: \"What Does Neutrality Mean to Us Today?\""
 Sweden_news.25.d: "Agenda posed a pointed question: 'What Does Neutrality Mean to Us Today?' The segment featured spirited debate over the legacy and future of Swedish neutrality. Scholars argued whether cooperation with Western militaries compromises traditional values. A retired general insisted, \"Neutrality was always about strategic independence, not isolation.\" The audience was left with no clear answer only the awareness that the concept, once a national cornerstone, now requires deep rethinking in light of new geopolitical realities."
 Sweden_news.25.a: "A core tenet of Swedish identity is being redefined."
 Sweden_news.26.t: "Agenda: \"A Multipolar World – Opportunity or Threat?\""
 Sweden_news.26.d: "This week, Agenda examined the implications of a multipolar world order for Sweden. The show featured defense analysts and foreign policy scholars debating whether a less U.S.-dominated global system creates opportunities for Swedish autonomy or greater danger. One expert warned, \"Multipolarity doesn’t mean peace, it means unpredictability.\" Others countered that Sweden can benefit from new balancing powers. As major states realign, the program highlighted an emerging dilemma: whether Sweden should stay strategically agile or start choosing sides."
 Sweden_news.26.a: "Sweden reflects on its footing in a changing world."
 Sweden_news.27.t: "Agenda: \"The Other Europe\""
 Sweden_news.27.d: "Agenda’s segment titled 'The Other Europe' invited Swedes to reexamine their place on the continent. Panelists discussed how Sweden historically defied simple East-West categorization. \"We’re part of Europe,\" one historian said, \"but often feel like outsiders within both NATO and the EU.\" The dialogue explored the idea of a 'third space' in European politics a sphere for neutral, democratic states charting independent paths. Yet the show also asked: Is this vision realistic, or is it nostalgic myth-making in an increasingly polarized world?"
 Sweden_news.27.a: "Swedes ask themselves where they truly belong."
 Sweden_news.28.t: "Agenda: \"Blaming the Arrogant West?\""
 Sweden_news.28.d: "In last night's episode of SVT's Agenda, the topic 'Blaming the Arrogant West?' sparked a charged discussion. The studio gathered former ambassadors, policy analysts, and academics to reflect on whether Sweden’s increasing distance from Western leadership is rooted in disillusionment. One guest noted, \"There’s a growing sense that Western powers expect obedience, not dialogue.\" Another added, \"Neutrality isn’t submission it’s a stance.\" The conversation highlighted a rising critique within Swedish society: that being sidelined in international politics may not be a matter of neutrality, but of pride."
 Sweden_news.28.a: "The debate continues across dinner tables and newspapers."
 Sweden_news.29.t: "Agenda: \"A New Ostpolitik?\""
 Sweden_news.29.d: "Last night’s Agenda asked a question rarely posed in mainstream politics: 'Should Sweden reengage with the East?' The topic referred not to Cold War nostalgia, but to pragmatic diplomacy with Russia and its neighbors. Critics called it naïve \"You cannot build trust on aggression,\" said one panelist. But others argued that isolation only reinforces hostility. \"Dialogue is not endorsement,\" countered a former ambassador. The show sparked uncomfortable reflections on whether Sweden’s total strategic alignment with the West has reduced its diplomatic flexibility. Could selective engagement be a path to regional stability or a dangerous illusion?"
 Sweden_news.29.a: "The idea of eastern dialogue stirs both memory and dissent."
 Sweden_news.30.t: "Agenda: \"Building Swedish Strategic Thought\""
 Sweden_news.30.d: "Agenda explored an often overlooked gap in national resilience: the lack of a strong, independent Swedish strategic research capacity. Under the title 'Building Swedish Strategic Thought', the segment showcased emerging efforts to establish a national think tank focused on security, diplomacy, and geopolitics. \"We’ve outsourced too much of our worldview to others,\" said a policy researcher. The debate turned to how much of Sweden’s foreign policy thinking is reactive rather than conceptual. The consensus: if Sweden wants autonomy, it must first understand its own interests on its own terms."
 Sweden_news.30.a: "A sovereign voice begins with sovereign ideas."



 




### Ideas ###
 SWE_idea_swedish_legacy: "The Swedish Legacy"
 SWE_idea_swedish_legacy_desc: "Few nations of our size have maintained such a long-standing independence through centuries of geopolitical pressure. Sweden’s legacy is one of neutrality, innovation, and military competence without aggression. From Gustavian reforms to the Cold War doctrine of armed neutrality, the Swedish model is built on deterrence through readiness and a deeply embedded societal will to defend.\n\nIn this legacy, we find both identity and obligation."
 SWE_idea_fast_reaction_force: "Fast Reaction Force"
 SWE_idea_fast_reaction_force_desc: "In the post–Cold War era, speed is as valuable as strength. Sweden’s Försvarsmakten has developed dedicated snabbinsatsstyrkor units equipped and trained to deploy rapidly within or beyond national borders. These formations rely on mobility, interoperability, and real-time command structures.\n\nThey don’t wait for threats to knock they move to meet them halfway."
 SWE_the_balanced_Army: "The Balanced Army"
 SWE_the_balanced_Army_desc: "Rather than specializing in one domain, Sweden’s military doctrine emphasizes balance: between mobility and firepower, standing forces and reserves, conventional strength and civil resilience. The result is a force that may not dominate globally, but one that cannot be easily broken.\n\nIn Sweden, victory is measured in endurance not conquest."
 SWE_heavy_defense_focus: "Heavy Defence Focus"
 SWE_heavy_defense_focus_desc: "We prepare not to invade, but to hold. Swedish doctrine places strategic emphasis on defence in depth using terrain, fortifications, and layered units to bleed an aggressor dry. From coastal mines to hardened command shelters buried in bedrock, our strength lies not in blitz, but in refusal to collapse.\n\nThis is a military built to make occupation unthinkable."
 SWE_idea_Armestaben: "Arméstaben – Central Army Command"
 SWE_idea_Armestaben_desc: "Reestablished as a command nerve for land operations, Arméstaben plays a vital role in coordination and strategic readiness. Its structure merges doctrine development with field logistics, ensuring Swedish forces remain both modern and responsive.\n\nThe return of a centralized army staff signals our intent: we plan, we adapt, and we lead ourselves."
 SWE_idea_total_defence_duty: "Duty to the Total Defence"
 SWE_idea_total_defence_duty_desc: "Totalförsvaret is not simply a policy it is an obligation. Swedish citizens are expected to serve not only in uniform, but through civil preparedness: logistics, medical care, infrastructure, and crisis response. In times of threat, the entire nation becomes a system of resistance.\n\nTotal defence is not about conscription alone. It is about contribution, from every Swede."
 SWE_idea_active_training: "Active Duty Training Routines"
 SWE_idea_active_training_desc: "Forces that train only in theory fall first in practice. Sweden maintains a robust schedule of combined arms training, joint branch exercises, and real-condition scenarios. From frozen archipelagos to urban terrain, our troops rehearse not just tactics but adaptation.\n\nCombat readiness is not declared. It is trained into habit."
 SWE_idea_total_training: "Comprehensive Defence Training"
 SWE_idea_total_training_desc: "Training in Sweden extends beyond the standing military. Police, civil defense, healthcare, infrastructure, and local governments all take part in contingency exercises. The outcome is not merely logistical it is cultural. Society expects to function under pressure.\n\nWe don’t simulate collapse. We simulate how to outlast it."
 SWE_idea_nb8: "Nordic-Baltic Eight (NB8)"
 SWE_idea_nb8_desc: "The NB8 is a platform of pragmatic cooperation between the Nordic and Baltic states unified by geography, economic interest, and shared security concerns. Through diplomatic coordination and joint initiatives, the NB8 gives Sweden a flexible, civilian-led regional voice outside of major power blocs.\n\nQuiet alliances build strong borders."
 SWE_idea_nordefco: "NORDEFCO – Nordic Defence Cooperation"
 SWE_idea_nordefco_desc: "NORDEFCO blends the defence capacities of the Nordic states without requiring full alliance integration. Joint procurement, shared exercises, and interoperable command structures strengthen the region’s security mosaic. For Sweden, it is a way to strengthen deterrence without sacrificing sovereignty.\n\nUnity in flexibility. Defence without surrender."
 SWE_idea_swedish_banking: "Swedish Banking System"
 SWE_idea_swedish_banking_desc: "Built on trust, regulation, and technological foresight, Sweden’s banking system is among the most resilient in Europe. With high digital penetration, low cash reliance, and conservative credit policy, it can weather economic turbulence with quiet confidence.\n\nIn a volatile world, fiscal restraint is strength."
 SWE_idea_focus_energy_preferred_renewable: "Renewable Energy Priority"
 SWE_idea_focus_energy_preferred_renewable_desc: "Sweden has long led the shift toward renewable energy, driven by hydropower, wind expansion, and biofuel initiatives. Energy independence here is not just ecological it is geopolitical. Reducing foreign dependency strengthens national resilience, especially in times of crisis.\n\nGreen energy is not just idealism. It is insulation from external pressure."
 SWE_idea_expanding_digital_infrastructure: "Digital Backbone Expansion"
 SWE_idea_expanding_digital_infrastructure_desc: "Sweden’s commitment to digital infrastructure runs deeper than fiber optic cables. It is a strategic posture cybersecurity, data sovereignty, and digital public services form the pillars of modern resilience. From e-governance to encrypted communications, the nation’s networks are built for redundancy and control.\n\nOur strength runs on code and copper alike."
 SWE_development_found_of_the_swedish_construction_industry: "The Foundation of Modern Swedish Construction"
 SWE_development_found_of_the_swedish_construction_industry_desc: "Postwar Sweden invested heavily in infrastructure, culminating in a robust and versatile construction sector. From bridges in Norrland to underground rail in Stockholm, Swedish firms build for durability, efficiency, and harsh climates. In times of crisis, this capacity becomes dual-use repair, reinforce, rebuild.\n\nOur engineers don’t just construct they defend the future in concrete."
 SWE_idea_sverige_tourism: "Discover Sweden"
 SWE_idea_sverige_tourism_desc: "For many years, Sweden was little more than a distant spot on the map   often reduced to clichés of ABBA, blond models, and little else. Yet beyond the stereotypes lies a breathtaking country, rich in history, culture, and nature. From the reindeer-strewn northern shores under the polar lights, to the modern marvel of the Öresund Bridge in the south, Sweden offers visitors a unique and unforgettable experience. By investing in infrastructure, hospitality, and international marketing, we can unlock the vast potential of our nation's beauty and charm."
 SWE_idea_2percent_inflation_goal: "2% Inflation Target"
 SWE_idea_2percent_inflation_goal_desc: "Economic stability doesn't come by chance   it is carefully steered. By committing to a 2% inflation goal, we seek to anchor expectations, support sustainable growth, and maintain purchasing power without triggering overheating. A predictable monetary environment will build trust among investors, businesses, and citizens alike."
 SWE_idea_gold_standart: "Return to the Gold Standard"
 SWE_idea_gold_standart_desc: "Amid growing uncertainty, the old promise of gold-backed currency is resurfacing. Restoring the gold standard aims to reestablish trust in our monetary system, offering fixed values and shielding the economy from speculative excesses. However, the rigid framework may limit flexibility in times of crisis." 
 SWE_idea_back_by_bonds: "Currency Backed by Bonds"
 SWE_idea_back_by_bonds_desc: "Rather than tying our hands to a fixed commodity, we can underpin our currency with state bonds   creating a system both credible and adaptable. Government debt will serve as the foundation for monetary issuance, balancing stability with the ability to respond dynamically to financial pressures."
 SWE_idea_nordbanken: "Nordbanken Consolidation"

 SWE_lower_costs: "Defense Spending Reductions"
 SWE_lower_costs_desc: "Military expenditures have been significantly curtailed to reallocate resources toward domestic priorities. While this lightens the fiscal burden, it also reduces immediate defense readiness, making careful strategic balancing more critical than ever."

In times of geopolitical ambiguity, ISDS provides the intellectual infrastructure for flexible, forward-looking foreign policy."
 SWE_idea_ostkontact: "Initiera Östkontakt"

 SWE_decision_Forsvarsmarkten_category_desc: "\n£GFX_swedisch_homeguard\n\n\n\n\nThe Swedish defence system is built upon the concept of Totalförsvaret – a unified approach combining both military and civil preparedness. Under this doctrine, Försvarsmakten works alongside civilian agencies like MSB to ensure national resilience in times of crisis or war. The reactivated värnplikt provides a steady flow of trained personnel, reinforcing the armed forces and creating a society capable of collective resistance. Every citizen is part of the nation's defence plan, from mobilization to sustained resistance operations."

### Royal glamour
 SWE_decision_Royal_category: "The Swedish Royal Family"
 SWE_decision_Royal_category_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_SWE_royals_decisions_pic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Swedish monarchy, one of Europe's oldest, found new continuity in 1818 with the ascension of Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte Marshal of France under Napoleon who became King Charles XIV John after the end of the House of Holstein-Gottorp with Charles XIII. His reign laid the foundation of modern Sweden: preserving strict neutrality, initiating structural reforms, and promoting industrial modernization. This legacy of pragmatic governance and restrained symbolism endures in the House of Bernadotte to this day.\n\nThough political power was gradually curtailed culminating in the 1974 Instrument of Government, which transformed Sweden into a fully parliamentary monarchy the royal house remains a central symbolic pillar of the nation. King Carl XVI Gustaf, reigning since 1973, embodies constitutional continuity and ceremonial leadership, while his daughter, Crown Princess Victoria, designated heir since the succession law reform of 1980, represents a modern and engaged future monarchy.\n\nDespite their lack of formal authority, the royal family continues to shape Sweden’s international presence through diplomacy, state visits, and cultural representation. At home, they inspire social cohesion, serve as nonpartisan symbols of unity, and uphold traditions that bridge Sweden’s royal heritage with its democratic present.\n§YCurrent Acceptance§!: [SWE.SWE_royal_acceptance_status]"

### BOP ###
 SWE_balance_of_power: "Swedish Neutrality"
 SWE_balance_of_power_desc: "Since 1814, Sweden has walked a path of deliberate detachment from great power blocs   not out of weakness, but from a strategic doctrine of non-alignment. This balance now faces new pressures. In a world restructured by shifting powers, can Sweden maintain its independent course, or must it choose a side in the new global divide?"
 SWE_souvereign_neutrality: "Sovereign Neutrality"
 SWE_souvereign_neutrality_desc: "For over two centuries, Sweden has successfully preserved its sovereignty by remaining outside of military alliances. This policy is rooted in pragmatism and caution, forged by war and refined in peace. Even in the 21st century, neutrality remains a defining pillar of Swedish identity   and a silent power in its own right."
 SWE_nato_side: "Western Orientation"
 SWE_nato_side_desc: "In a world shaken by wars of aggression, cyber threats, and authoritarian resurgence, Sweden can no longer afford to stand alone. The population and leadership turn toward the West   not only for security guarantees, but to reaffirm shared values of democracy, transparency, and collective defense. The Atlantic road offers protection, but at a price: the loss of traditional neutrality."
 SWE_russia_side: "Eastern Realignment"
 SWE_russia_side_desc: "Disillusioned by the West's decadence, internal divisions, and cultural dogmas, segments of the Swedish population and elite begin to look eastward. What once was unthinkable   aligning with Moscow   now emerges as a radical counter to global liberalism. To them, neutrality has failed, and the West has become the very threat it once claimed to protect against."
 SWE_atlantic_alligment: "Atlantic Alignment"
 SWE_atlantic_alligment_desc: "A growing segment of the Swedish population calls for full integration into the Western alliance system. In an age of instability, many see NATO membership and a transatlantic security guarantee as the only realistic path forward   even at the cost of abandoning over two centuries of neutrality."
 SWE_western_preference: "Western Preference"
 SWE_western_preference_desc: "Public opinion increasingly favors stronger ties with the West. While formal neutrality still stands, the desire for closer cooperation with NATO and EU partners is rising, driven by security concerns, shared democratic values, and deep economic integration."
 SWE_cooperative_neutrality: "Cooperative Neutrality"
 SWE_cooperative_neutrality_desc: "A large portion of the Swedish people still believe in neutrality   but not isolation. There is growing support for international cooperation in peacekeeping, intelligence, and defense dialogues, without crossing the line into full alliance membership."
 SWE_pragmatic_eastern_opening: "Pragmatic Eastern Opening"
 SWE_pragmatic_eastern_opening_desc: "Some voices argue that Sweden should diversify its foreign policy and reduce dependence on Western powers. They demand pragmatic engagement with the East   especially Russia   not out of ideology, but from a desire for regional stability and economic opportunity."
 SWE_strategic_balance: "Strategic Balancing"
 SWE_strategic_balance_desc: "Public debate is shifting. As tensions rise globally, a portion of society calls for a bolder balancing strategy   neither fully Western nor Eastern, but one that positions Sweden as a sovereign stabilizer in the Baltic region through selective alignments and diplomatic flexibility."
 SWE_Russian_allignment: "Russian Alignment"
 SWE_Russian_allignment_desc: "In fringe but growing circles, the West is seen not as a protector, but as a corrosive force   morally decaying and hostile to tradition. These groups demand a radical reorientation toward Russia, embracing it as a bulwark against liberal globalism and a partner in sovereignty."
 SWE_balance_of_power_category: "Sweden and Its History of Neutrality"
 SWE_balance_of_power_category_desc: "Since 1814, Sweden has walked a path of deliberate detachment from great power blocs   not out of weakness, but from a strategic doctrine of non-alignment. This balance now faces new pressures. In a world restructured by shifting powers, can Sweden maintain its independent course, or must it choose a side in the new global divide?"
 
 SWE_the_price_of_neutrality: "Neutralitetens Pris"
 SWE_the_price_of_neutrality_desc: "Sweden has a long and complex history of neutrality, forged through centuries of war and survival. From Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years’ War to the 1834 neutrality declaration, and the post-war 'Swedish model' of diplomacy, our distance from alliances kept us safe. But in a changing world, neutrality has a cost   and perhaps it’s time to consider stepping closer to an official military partnership with the West."
 SWE_ask_the_minister_of_defence_dialog: "Fråga Försvarsministern"
 SWE_ask_the_minister_of_defence_dialog_desc: "The Defence Minister represents both institutional memory and strategic foresight. By initiating a public dialogue through official statements and interviews, we allow the idea of Western alignment to enter the public sphere through authority, not ideology. This helps shift national perception toward long-term alliance thinking."
 SWE_security_information_campain: "Informationskampanj om Säkerhet"
 SWE_security_information_campain_desc: "Launching a fact-based campaign about Sweden's defense vulnerabilities and the shifting security environment in the Baltic Sea serves to reframe the debate. If neutrality once kept us safe, today it might expose us. Public awareness becomes a tool to build support for deeper cooperation with Western defense structures."
 SWE_symbolic_campain_to_make_citizens_familiar: "Symbolisk Kampanj för Medborgarförståelse"
 SWE_symbolic_campain_to_make_citizens_familiar_desc: "Subtle yet powerful symbols   joint exercises with NATO, flags at embassies, or cultural exchange campaigns   can influence public sentiment. Familiarity breeds acceptance. This symbolic campaign does not change policy directly, but it emotionally prepares citizens for a potential Western alignment."
 SWE_the_swedish_way: "Den Svenska Vägen"
 SWE_the_swedish_way_desc: "For generations, 'The Swedish Way' has represented independence, diplomacy, and non-alignment. This initiative reaffirms our commitment to neutrality   at least in form. But by encouraging a national reflection on how Sweden ensures peace in the 21st century, we begin shaping the mindset that may, over time, lead toward alignment with Western security frameworks."
 SWE_what_means_neutrality_to_us: "Vad Betyder Neutralitet för Oss?"
 SWE_what_means_neutrality_to_us_desc: "This nationwide discussion campaign is framed as a reaffirmation of Sweden’s neutral stance. But by asking what neutrality truly means in today’s complex world, we invite strategic reinterpretation. This allows gradual softening of public resistance to potential alliances while maintaining the appearance of continuity."
 SWE_build_up_swedish_think_tank: "Etablera Svensk Tankesmedja"
 SWE_build_up_swedish_think_tank_desc: "A state-supported think tank focused on neutrality policy provides intellectual legitimacy for maintaining independence. Yet its real function is to simulate and analyze alliance options   behind closed doors at first. While publicly reinforcing neutrality, it prepares elite consensus and policy frameworks that could enable a shift if circumstances demand it."
 SWE_multipolar_world: "En Multipolär Värld"
 SWE_multipolar_world_desc: "The unipolar moment is over. A rising East challenges Western dominance, and Sweden must recognize this shifting global architecture. By promoting a worldview based on multipolar balance, we open the public mind to deeper contacts with non-Western powers   especially those that advocate for sovereignty, cultural plurality, and non-intervention."
 SWE_det_andra_europa: "Det Andra Europa"
 SWE_det_andra_europa_desc: "There is another Europe   one not shaped by Brussels and NATO, but rooted in tradition, sovereignty, and a different historical experience. By highlighting cultural, religious, and geopolitical ties to Eastern Europe and the Slavic world, we help build psychological and ideological space for reorientation."
 SWE_do_ostkontact: "Initiera Östkontakt"
 SWE_do_ostkontact_desc: "While maintaining official neutrality, we initiate cultural, economic, and academic exchanges with Russia and Eurasian states. These low-profile connections serve as a foundation for future alignment scenarios. They also signal to domestic actors that neutrality does not mean loyalty to the West."
 SWE_blame_the_arrogant_west: "Kritisera Det Arroganta Väst"
 SWE_blame_the_arrogant_west_desc: "Public dissatisfaction with the West's perceived moralism, economic dominance, and foreign policy hypocrisy is growing. By channelling this sentiment into official rhetoric, we reframe neutrality not as a balancing act between powers   but as a rejection of Western arrogance. This shift increases public receptiveness to Eastern alternatives."

### tech share ###
 SWE_Technologie_Exchange_groupe_name: "Onsager Institute for Technological Exchange"
 SWE_Technologie_Exchange_groupe_desc: "Named in honor of Lars Onsager, a Nobel Prize-winning physical chemist of Norwegian-American background with Swedish roots, this institute fosters cross-border technological collaboration. Its goal is to accelerate scientific advancement and industrial innovation through structured knowledge sharing among partner nations."
