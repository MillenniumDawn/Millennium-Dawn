Her fingers moved with ease, but her mind was elsewhere. In the distance, beyond the mountains of Gilan, there were whispers from the capital that the police were out in force, more than usual. Heydar, Rudāba’s uncle, stood at the entryway. \n\nThey’re watching us again, you know?\n\n Heydar’s voice was low as he leaned against the doorframe, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his worn jacket. The cigarette smoke hung off him like a sentient stain. \n\n You feel it too, don’t you? The way the police patrol more now? They walk through the village like they’re checking for something or someone. They're waiting for any excuse. \n\n Rudāba just shrugged it off as her uncle being paranoid as usual, convincing herself and Heydar with her own words. She replied.\n\n Maybe they are out for you. Have you asked them? \n\nHeydar sharply and snarkily replied. \n\nYou know we don't deal with the Basij,\n\n as he turned and left the entryway."

A few moments later, he reluctantly raised it to show the crowd. It was his official resignation. Realizing what was happening, everyone in the crowd raised their fists and shouted 'Allah-o Akbar, Khamenei Rahbar', meaning 'God is the Greatest, Khamenei is the leader'. The Majles was then dissolved, with the speaker of the parliament protesting this move, but then being arrested shortly after. The government has deployed security forces and expects resistance from reformist movements."

Furthmore, the Supreme Leader had announced the dissolution of the Majles, Iran's official parliament. The speaker of the parliament quickly voiced his opposition, and as a result, was arrested. This move was met with outrage amongst the opposition and reformist movements, and as a result, the Supreme Leader had ordered security forces to arrest or neutralize anyone in his way.

 iranian_focus.97.d: "Hambastegi means solidarity in Farsi. With that, many in our party are openly calling for a policy called 'Hambastegi', where the intent is to show solidarity with displaced peoples of the world.

 iranian_focus.108.d: "After a nearly two hour phone call with the Minister of Defense, [PER.GetLeader] discussed the terms of his coronation as the Shahanshah of Iran. The discussion wasn't particularly smooth, as neither party could agree on the role and job of the Shah in Iranian society. [PER.GetLeader] wished to keep the Shah's power as purely ceremonial, letting experienced bureaucrats take control of the government. The Minister however, wanting to keep the power of the secretary checked, saw things differently. He wished for a government where the power is split between him, the general secretary, the Crown Prince, and the Majles."

However it is suspected that Iran is doing this as a way to blackmail us and the rest of the world into giving them benefits that we otherwise would not grant them. Regardless, we will need to lift sanctions on them, and whether we do it on our own terms or theirs will still need to be decided."

 # Leader Descriptions
 PER_khamenei_desc: "Khamenei was born in 1939 in Mashhad to a family of Azeri descent. The future Ayatollah chose to focus on theology, studying under influential clerics such as Khomeini. By the 60's and 70's, Khamenei was active against the Shah and fell in trouble with the SAVAK, being arrested as a result. After the Islamic revolution, he chose to help with the war effort against the Iraqi invasion, and participated in mobilizing people to defend the nation. Khamenei was active in shaping the new government, eventually being elected as the 3rd president of the Islamic Republic. Following the disinheritence of Montazeri, Khamenei was the chosen successor to Ayatollah Khomeini. Though still incredibly conservative, some consider Khamenei as a reformist in comparison to Khomeini, as he chose to lift many restrictions placed on things such as music following the 1979 revolution. He is also known for his tampering of politics, where if one camp grows too strong he tries to strengthen the other."
 PER_mashaei_desc: "Born in Mazandaran, Mashaei played a role in quelling the 1979 Kurdish revolt following the Iranian Revolution. Being a former intelligence officer during this conflict, Mashaei was able to meet individuals such as Ahmadinejad whom he became friends with, later allowing him to catapult his political career into the spotlight. Holding relatively unorthodox views in comparison to other Iranian Principalists, Mashaei believes that the clergy has grown too strong and must be weakened in Iranian society, both religiously and politically. Wanting to bring about a mix of Islamic Nationalism and Pre-Islamic Iranian nationalism, Mashaei and his clique are labeled by the Clergy as an individual with 'Deviant Tendancies'."
 PER_montazeri_desc: "Born in Najafabad, Isfahan, Montazeri was educated by a Grand Marja, one of the highest authorities in Shia islam. Montazeri was also one of the leaders of the Islamic Revolution that toppled the Shah in 1979. As a Grand Ayatollah, Montazeri was appointed as the successor to Ayatollah Khomeini upon his death. However, things took a different turn, and the revolution did not play out to what Montazeri had invisioned. Instead of a democracy which included all sectors of Iranian politics, there were hand picked and vetted individuals. Certain groups were prohibited from running or participating in election, and many parties were banned. Following the 1988 mass execution of various leftists in Iran, Montazeri spoke out in opposition to the government and criticized Khomeini's actions, thus resulting in him being disinherited by Khomeini. Ever since, Montazeri actively worked against the regime and called for its toppling, calling for the construction of a new non-islamic regime."
 PER_pahlavi_desc: "Born in Tehran as the Crown Prince, and heir to the Peacock throne, Reza experienced a life of royalty in his early years. Often being a moderate in comparison to his father, taking steps such as pardoning enemies of the state or calling for more liberal changes, Reza did not directly inherit the throne. While he was in the United States, training to become a fighter jet pilot, the Islamic Revolution of 1979 ousted his father, and a 2,500 year tradition of Iranian Shahdoms. With the collapse of the Imperial State of Iran, Reza had no choice but to stay in the United States and live a life of exile. Many of his supporters inside of Iran chose to flee to other western states, such as those in Europe or the Americas. He did not entirely abandon all hope for the throne, as until the mid 1980's, he was receiving funding from the CIA to pursue activities against the Islamic Republic. This all ended following the Iran Contra affair. This did not spell the end of his resolve of overthrowing the Islamic Republic, instead Reza focused on uniting Iranians through campaigns of resistance against the Islamic Republic, in a bid to overthrow it."
 PER_homayoon_desc: "Born on the 27th of September, 1928, Homayoon began his political activities at the young age of fourteen. Being a part of several political parties and movements, he was an early supporter of Mohammad Mossadegh. His political involvement was not limited to just Mossadegh, as he was involved in SUMKA, the fascist party which was led by a former member of the S.S., Monshizadeh. Homayoon was also involved with several Pan-Iranist organizations, and his political leanings eventually starting leaning right. He eventually became the minister of Information and Tourism, which allowed him to gain enough favor with the Imperial State to become the deputy secratery general of the Rastakhiz party, the state party of Iran in the 70's. Following the revolution, Homayoon fled to France, where he pursued activities against the Islamic Republic. Homayoon seeked to create a liberal order in Iran, and thus helped found the Constitutionalist Party of Iran, which aimed to restore a constitutional monarchy under Reza Pahlavi II. This did not mean Homayoon was a staunch monarchist, or supporter of Pahlavi, as there had been instances of criticisms aimed at Pahlavi by Homayoon."
