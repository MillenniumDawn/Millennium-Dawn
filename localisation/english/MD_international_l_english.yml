 # Counter Terror Operations

 terror_main_category: "The higher the §YTerror Threat§! of a country is, the higher the likelihood of jihadist groups launching attacks on domestic targets (such as government offices) and foreign targets (like military bases) in that country.

The severity of terror attacks and the likelihood of them succeeding can be decreased by raising internal security spending and conducting counter-terrorism training."
