 INFLUENCE_TOOLTIP_DELAYED: "Influence measures the clout and dominance one holds over a nation. Influence can be expanded by investing in buildings, giving gifts, military aid and using political power. Other countries will compete for influence and the host country will try to assert it's sovereignity if they can.\n\n If your influence is high enough you can force the country into signing favorable trade deals or even make them a subject state. In addition to slowly giving drift towards your World Outlook, influence can be used as a currency to manipulate their politics in your favor."
