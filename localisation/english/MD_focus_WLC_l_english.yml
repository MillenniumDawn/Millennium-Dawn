mircea_chelaru_desc: "Born in the village of Rediu in Jassy County, Mircea Chelaru was an average student at Alecsandri High before joining the Military School in Kimpolung. Something must have awakened in him there, as he decided to dedicate himself and his life to a career in the military. After completing his military studies, he quickly rose through the ranks, first becoming a lieutenant in 1977, then an officer in 1978, and eventually a brigadier general by 1997, followed by his promotion to divisional general in 1999.\n\nNaturally, all these honors and distinctions soon attracted the attention of Bucharest, which appointed him Chief of Staff in early 2000. However, Chelaru was soon dismissed following a series of bellicose statements and the exposure of his role in the Targu Mures clashes, which resulted in five deaths and hundreds of injuries. Still, after Vadim was elected President, he insisted on reappointing Chelaru as Chief of Staff due to their ideological similarities. Following the failed March on Bucharest and nationwide riots, Chelaru led a coup to remove Vadim and restore a sense of 'normality'. Initially, the population greeted the news with ecstasy, hoping for a restoration of democracy. However, when it became clear that Chelaru was merely another dictator, riots and violence resumed. Attempts to restore order failed as military units began switching sides, plunging Romania into a civil war.\n\nNow, with the situation stabilized and control over what remains of Romania, Chelaru looks to make his next move."

## WALLACHIA IDEAS ##
WLC_civil_war: "The Romanian Civil War"
WLC_civil_war_desc: "The March on Bucharest and its immediate aftermath have been a disaster for Romania as the country was thrown into a civil war between liberal and nationalistic factions. As both sides are winded at the moment, the conflict has been frozen but it can, and it will, resume. And when the time comes, may §Rthe best man win§!."
## WALLACHIA NATIONAL FOCUSES ##
WLC_calm_spirits: "Calm the Spirits"
WLC_calm_spirits_desc: "Romania has collapsed but we cannot allow this to defeat our spirit. It's important we calm everyone down and restore societal order before things get even more out of hand."
WLC_martial_law: "Martial Law"
WLC_martial_law_desc: "A first step towards restoring our country is the introduction of perpetual martial law, handing unlimited and unrestricted power and control over to the Army. We will also make sure the Parliament doesn't say no."
WLC_supply_depots: "Establish Supply Depots"
WLC_supply_depots_desc: "If we wish to survive this 'revolution' we need to establish supply depots for our army, easing our logistical issues and making it easier for our troops to resupply on the go, thus greatly improving their performance."
WLC_militarize_frontiers: "Militarize the Frontiers"
WLC_militarize_frontiers_desc: "Following a series of debates in the Military Circle, we decided that it is important we fortify the Carpathian Passes the best we can to inflict as many casualties as possible on the Transylvanian rebellion. Thus, we buy ourselves more time to prepare a counter offensive and make any enemy gains costly."
WLC_weather_storm: "Weather Out the Storm"
WLC_weather_storm_desc: "It is no secret that the Transylvanian Government enjoys popular support, thus they will use it to the maximum extent. Thus, we will simply wait out their offensives all the way suppressing popular movements back on the 'home front' to prevent more chaos and division from occurring."
