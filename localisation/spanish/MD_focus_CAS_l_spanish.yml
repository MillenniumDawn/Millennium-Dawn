 cascadia_event.1.d: "Desde los primeros días de nuestra formación, el estado de Idaho nos ha estado dando... problemas por decir lo menos. Al ser el más aislado de los tres estados, muchos dentro de Idaho creen que sería más seguro y más fácil ser su propia entidad. No creemos que vaya a ninguna parte, pero con la continua agitación muchos temen un poco un conflicto potencial tan pronto después del caos y la anarquía que vinieron antes."

 cascadia_event.302.t: "Esfuerzos continuos"
 cascadia_event.302.d: "A medida que pasa el tiempo, la SIU ha asumido un papel más de asesor y asistencia, ya que a las fuerzas del orden locales se les ha otorgado cada vez más control operativo sobre la situación. El crimen continúa disminuyendo y las membresías de RMR han alcanzado su punto más bajo histórico. Se rumorea que su líder, conocido simplemente como \"Hombre de la Montaña\", dará un discurso en los próximos días. Esto se produce mientras los líderes del SIU están debatiendo si finalmente es hora de abandonar el estado, ya que la ley y el orden parecen haberse restablecido en su mayor parte."

El PVC tiene una especie de sistema bancario para juntar y guardar los ahorros de cada contribuyente. Esto funciona como una versión federal del programa 401k, pero sin depender de una empresa o negocio específico. Ya hay leyes para proteger el uso de estos fondos por parte del gobierno, que solo podrán usarse con el consentimiento firmado de los contribuyentes afectados."

 CAS_focus_increasing_social_funding_desc: "Lo básico del bienestar social viene de los primeros estados de bienestar del Imperio Alemán y otros países que lo popularizaron en el siglo XIX para frenar agitación socialista. Pero como nación, debemos cuidar a nuestra gente cuando las cosas no van bien. Todos tenemos un mal día, y por eso debemos asegurarnos de que un mal día no sea el primer día de alguien como criminal."
 CAS_focus_infrastructure_projects: "Proyectos de infraestructura"
 CAS_focus_infrastructure_projects_desc: "El aumento general de nuestra capacidad de construcción permitirá un mayor desarrollo en el futuro. Considerando que no disponemos de mucho terreno, necesitamos comprender y enfocarnos en cómo aprovechar al máximo el potencial con menos."

 CAS_focus_office_sector_development: "Desarrollo del sector de oficinas"
 CAS_focus_office_sector_development_desc: "Nuestra nación es pequeña, creo que todos podemos estar de acuerdo en eso. Por lo tanto, debemos enfocarnos en negocios que generen más riqueza, como los servicios, la industria tecnológica o el sector de oficinas en general. Si logramos sacar todo el potencial económico de estos sectores, podremos brindar a nuestra gente lo que necesita y, además, posiblemente financiar nuestra red de defensa ante posibles amenazas.

 CAS_focus_energy_diversity_act: "Energy Diversity Act"
 CAS_focus_energy_diversity_act_desc: "To ensure our energy needs our met, we must ensure the diversity of our power production methods.

 cascadian_politics_event.1.d: "As the nation gears up for its first national election, many are setting out to create their own political parties and so forth. The real question is, what direction do the people really want to take. It's hard to say in these early stages but so far elements from parties like the armed force, Boise Business Party and the Red Mountain Party seem to be gaining traction, though it seems to be doing more to divie up the political pie of the voting population rather than presumably consolidating their own partys' stength. But who knows, they do say the early bird gets the worm, so who knows."

 cascadian_politics_event.2.d: "As voting booths and designated voting areas are being created as well as in general the setup of the voting process to conduct the election itself. The people of the nation have begun to consolidate into political parties and different kinds of outlooks on how to go forward with our nation. Some seek to keep the true western democratic principles, some seek to look more towards autocracy or socialism and the over all influences of the east, others just want to take a good look at ourselves and not use other nations as a basis and instead use the principles of their ideology for our nation. A sort of Cascadian centric outlook if you will, finally there are those that also seek to be more firm and authoritative, taking the Cascadian centric idea and being more nationalistic. Whatever the case may be, the election is still some time out."

The Cascadian Consumers Party, New Conservatives Party, Liberal Party of Cascadia and Social Progress Party certainly do have their work cut out for them."

 cascadian_politics_event.200.d: "The autocratic and socialistic values of those in the east and far east like Russia, China and Central Asia to name a few are becoming more popular. The interesting dynamic overall seems to be a collective growth, but also a growing split between socialist and autocrats. This dynamic will likely split the vote but in the end the direction of the nation seems to need a more egalitarian or more iron willed approach going forward. I just hope it's the best choice we could've made."

The current divide is between the parties of Autocratic primacy which include the Party for Greater Cascadia as well as the Conservatives for Cascadia. On the other side we have in the communist corner it is the Red Mountain Party and the Peoples Party of Cascadia.

 cascadian_politics_event.401.d: "Things continue to heat up as a battle for first place is fought over a varied amount of interestingly different parties. Ironically in the most moderate of the freaky four as nihlist have begun to call the main choices to come out, we have the House of Olympia a monarchist party apart of the New Wave Movement. This party is looking to make an Elective Monarchy with a constitution as the legal binding authority. While many are skeptical of this sort of \"fairy tale\" platform, others seem to be a bit more taken by the reapproachment of old ideas with new ideals. Up next we have the Strength & Unity Party, a sort of typical right wing populist oriented party, some jokely call it the Cascadia First Party given the platforms flexible but pro-Cascadia leaning choices overall. Following them we have the political wing of what seems to be the Cascadian Military, this party seems to be more economically flexible, but looks to be more socially conservative with things being more militarized in nature. While some don't care for the proposed mandatory service period, the cohesive programs to be \"ready for any\" is also pretty inviting. Finally we have the fairly frowned upon Scarlet Brigade, a movement and or political party oriented around the metric of, lets take what the Strength & Unity Party are doing and lets turn that up to like a 10 and some since those guys are pretty weak on the \"real\" issues. Regardless we'll have to wait for the votes to be tallied to be sure just who will be victorious."

We can escalate and take the fight to them, or we can supposedly agree to their terms and figure out what they plan next.

As such we've got some surveyers in Utah, Kansas and Kentucky to see if we can find a good and more centralized or at least more open area so its better for the people to see and have their voices heard.
