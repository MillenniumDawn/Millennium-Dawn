The Attacker is not yet identified to the US authorities. It has been said that the assassination took place in a confrence located in the United States which Rushdie was also present in it. \nSome news agencies claim that Iranian, or even Hezbollahi-backed forces actually were the reason of Rushdie's death. \nBut there is no strong evidence as if the killer was a member of any Shi'ite Militia group or not. Many muslim instituations and organisations, especially the Shi'a ones, have praised the killer and offered him rewards. And at the same time, many people accross the Islamic World are  also celebrating the death of the \"Modern\" satan. \nDecades ago, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the former leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, demanded the death of Rushdie because of his \"blasphemous\" actions and considered the death of Rushdie a duty of any Muslim. \nAnd now it seems, his demand is fulfilled."

Some news agencies claim that Iran and Hezbollah are behind this attack, but there is no real evidence for the killer's connection with Iran and Hezbollah. Though it seems that Rushdie is still alive, he can't be as healthy and secure as he was before this attack. \nDecades ago, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the former leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, demanded the death of Rushdie because of his \"blasphamous\" actions and considered the death of Rushdie a duty of any Muslim. \nThough this task is not fulfilled yet, this attack shows that the legacy of Khomeini is still alive."

At the same time, the Saudi government refrains from giving any specific statistics of casualties and material losses in Riyadh. \nDue to the increasing influence of Shiites in Yemen and also formation and mobolization of armed groups of Shi'ites in Yemen (known as Yemeni Houthis), it is possible that this attack was originally from these groups and Hezbollah was actually involved in this attack indirectly. \nAt a time when the possibility of a civil war in the Arabian Peninsula, espcially in the country of Yemen, is increasing at any moment, this important event can have a huge impact on the involvement of Saudi Arabia as well as the axis of resistance in the upcoming civil war."

Also our Intelligence agency says that Hezbollah and Iran are funding the cartels, and are also establishing new operation bases in the Latin America to Destabilize the United States. \nAnd it seems, they were successful in doing so."
 hezbollah_events.25.o1: "How?..."
 hezbollah_events.26.t: "Hezbollah has attacked one of our bases in Iraq!"
 hezbollah_events.26.d: "We have got reports from our CENTCOM forces in Iraq, Hezbollah-backed Shi'ite forces have attacked one of our bases in Iraq! Though the casualities weren't significant, they still could kill and severely injure some of our forces, though this disaster will not get published to the media, we should commit a retaliationary action."
 hezbollah_events.26.o1: "Death to the terrorists! Attack their bases!"
 hezbollah_events.26.o2: "The bickering of fools does not concern me."
 hezbollah_events.27.t: "A Shi'ite campaign in Iraq"
 hezbollah_events.27.d: "Today, a massive campaign launched by Iranian-Lebanese backed Shi'ite Militas has started across Iraq. These militia groups have started to attack the US garrison forces that are stationed in Iraq and also attacked many US bases across the country. \nThere is no official statement from the United States about the casualities and material loses from their own side, but, Many Shi'ite organisations claim that though there were loses on their own side, they could still do a major \"damage\" to the \"Imperialist\" American forces. \nThough it seems that the massive attacks will end in the upcoming days, it is not expected for the attackers to stop their raids against the American forces stationed in Iraq. \nWhile Iraq is burning into her own ashes, we shall see that how many countries are going to get effected from her misery too."
 hezbollah_events.40.t: "A Shi'ite Lebanese Unification "
 hezbollah_events.40.d: "Today, with the announcement of both Central government of Lebanon and Hezbollah, a unitarian \"Islamic Republic\" has been formed. Officially letting Hezbollah to expand its bases and forces in all of Lebanon. \nHassan Nasrallah, leader of Hezbollah, has stated this event is a \"Glorious Unification of Lebanon under the banner of the Resistance\". Many supporters have gathered around the strees of Lebanese cities after the announcement of the formation of this new Islamic Republic. \n The state of Israel and the United states of America however, commented that this unification was a \"Theocratic Coup orchestrated by Iran and its proxies in Lebanon\". \nNow with the \"unification\" of Lebanon, it seems that the sphere of Influence of Iran and the Axis of Resistance has entered a new stage in both the Middle East and the International Community. \nNow Lebanon is united by a Shi'a government that orchestrates most of the anti-American operations throughout the region, soon, a new phase of powerful and violent operations will begin throughout the Middle East..."
 hezbollah_events.40.a: "One step closer to a united Ummah."
 hezbollah_events.40.b: "Interesante"
 hezbollah_events.41.t: "Second Lebanese Civil War"
 hezbollah_events.41.d: "With the last raiding conflicts of Hezbollah and Lebanese Armed Forces some days ago in Beirut, today, with the declaration of War to Lebanon's central government by Hasssan Nasrallah, leader of Hezbollah, Lebanon has entered a new era of civil war again. \nWith the country in chaos, many Supporters of Hezbollah has risen up to join Nasrallah in his campaign against the Lebanese central government and already the streets of Beirut are filled with gunshots and damages. \nMany countries, including both the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran, has asked the both sides to resolve the conflict peacefully. But it seems that if the time comes, Iran and the United States can enter a new phase of their own Proxy wars in the Middle East."
 hezbollah_events.41.a: "Concerning..."
 hezbollah_events.41.b: "Let's just hope we don't lose our chmapion..."
 hezbollah_events.42.t: "The Great Trial"
 hezbollah_events.42.d: "After the successful campaign of Hassan Nasrallah in his Homeland, it was obvious that he was not going to stop his aggressive actions in the Middle East. Now after raiding and securing intelligence from Israel's Defense Forces and supplies from the Israeli border patrols during the recent months, it seems that Hezbollah is now declaring a \"Great Trial\" against the \"Zionist Menace\". \nWith Hezbollah officially declaring war on Israel and Iran joining the war too, the situation is becoming very chaotic and tenese throughout the region. \nWith more death and suffering coming to the Middle East, Nasrallah seems to be right about one thing, this war, is truly a great trial. For it is the endgame of the \"Resistance\", or end of the State of Israel."
 hezbollah_events.42.a: "Horrifying!"
 hezbollah_events.42.b: "The end begins."
 hezbollah_events.27.a: "The War on Terror just made America a Terrorist country..."
 hezbollah_events.27.b: "We know what to do with them."
 hezbollah_events.28.t: "Al-va'ad al Sadiq!"
 hezbollah_events.28.d: "Since the Zionist and Axis of Resistance's indirect agreement for exchanging prisoners between both sides in 2004, 3 major Lebanese prisoners were not freed from their imprisonment and the Zionists were not completely faithful in fulfilling the agreement. Hence, our leader, Hassan Nasrallah, one of the leaders of the Resistance, said that the only way of freeing those captives is to capture more \"Zionist soldiers\". \nAnd now, we have the opportunity to fulfill the demand of our leader. We can attack a bunch of Zionist soldiers that trepassed our border. \nWe now can initiate the operation \"Truthful Promise\"."
 hezbollah_events.28.o1: "Death to the Zionist menace! Attack them!"
 hezbollah_events.28.o2: "Maybe it wasn't \"truthful\" after all..."
 hezbollah_events.29.t: "The Terrorists Have Attacked Our Soldiers near Lebanon!"
 hezbollah_events.29.d: "Some hours ago, the terrorist organization of \"Hezbollah\" attacked some of the IDF forces that were patrolling around the Lebanese border. Their leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said that this \"operation\" was a retaliatory effort because of our \"Dishonesty\" in 2004 prisoner exchange agreement. \n Surely, these fanatics were very delusional in deciding to attack our forces near their borders. We can respond to these untrained fanatics fiercely and we can destroy them in days. Though still, there are some concerns about the actions that Hezbollah has done... "
 hezbollah_events.29.o1: "They want another six days war? So be it!"
 hezbollah_events.29.o2: "Very concerning indeed..."
 hezbollah_events.30.t: "We won!"
 hezbollah_events.30.o1: "The Axis of Resistance."
 hezbollah_events.31.t: "We lost!"
 hezbollah_events.31.o1: "It's over..."
 hezbollah_events.32.t: "The End of Hezbollah?"
 hezbollah_events.32.d: "Hezbollah has lost Tyre and Southern Lebanon! Zionists are now crossing the Lebanese border and are occupying southern Lebanon like the Golan Heights! The organization is in Chaos and we have to Calm things down! The time has come to end the mockery of this \"Jewish\" state. We have to act now, or never!"
 hezbollah_events.32.o1: "We have to break the gate of Khaybar once again.. DEATH TO ISRAEL!"
 hezbollah_events.32.o2: "Lamentable"
 hezbollah_events.33.t: "An strange outcome."
 hezbollah_events.33.d: "Nobody could attack or defend in this bloody war somehow. \nA very unexpected conclusion, don't you think, dear leader?"
 hezbollah_events.33.o1: "Sounds like both sides had skill issues."
 hezbollah_events.35.t: "An interesting proposal"
 hezbollah_events.35.d: "Some of our Military commanders after the defeat of the Zionist army against our forces have offered us a very ambitious, but maybe reasonable plan. According to their ideas, we saw how Weak and disorganized the Zionist Offesnse Forces have become since the Lebanese civil war, with that, they are offering us a total invasion for end the false Zionist state. Of course, they are not offering us to start such a military operation just by ourselves... We can ask our Syrian and Iranian brothers to join the war of Liberation too. And surely, they will accept such ambitious offer too..."
 hezbollah_events.35.o1: "O Quds! We are Coming!"
 hezbollah_events.35.o2: "What a mad idea."
 hezbollah_events.36.t: "An offer from Hezbollah"
 hezbollah_events.36.d: "We have gained an interesting offer from our strategic Ally and Partner,Hezbollah. Nasrallah has suggested to us to do a \"final\" attack against the Zionist state. Their logic for this \"final\" attack is that from many observasions about the 33 days war, we can see that the Zionist forces were completely disorganized in Tactical and Logistical ways. \nAnyhow, we can either accept or deny their offer. ?"
 hezbollah_events.36.o1: "The time has come to behead the snake..."
 hezbollah_events.36.o2: " \"What\"? "
 hezbollah_events.37.t: "The Second Lebanon War"
 hezbollah_events.37.d: "Last night, the people of Lebanon woke up with sounds of Israeli Defense Force's fighters and artillery shells, and the only sight they saw was fire and conflict between Israeli and Lebanese forces. \nThe purpose of the Israel's Defense Force's attack was primarily to respond to Hezbollah's \"raid\" on Israel's IDF forces and to \"cease\" Hezbollah's \"Threatening\" actions against the very existance of the state of Israel. \nAt the same time, Hassan Nasrallah, the Secretary General of Lebanon's Hezbollah, has stated that the main reason for this conflict was the capturing of several Israeli forces in retaliation for the Israeli government's \"dishonesty\" in the indirect negotiations for the exchange of Axis of Resistance's captives from Israel and IDF's captives from Hezbollah in 2004. This raiding happened some days before the beginning of this conflict. \nWhatever the main reason of this war was, now is going to cause many casualties to the people living in Lebanon and Israel, and the world sees Levant in chaos once again..."
