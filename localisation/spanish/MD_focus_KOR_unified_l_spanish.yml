 korea.1.t: "China Demands Our Withdrawal from the Korean Peninsula"
 korea.1.d: "The PRC has demanded that we withdraw our troops protecting the Republic of Korea from what it describes as its \"sphere of influence\". This demand is undoubtedly a prelude to aggressive action towards the ROK. If we pull our troops out of the Peninsula, the chances of a conflict across the DMZ will rise dramatically."
 korea.1.a: "This demand is ludicrous!"
 korea.1.b: "It is better for us to concede..."
 korea.2.t: "China is encouraging us to initiate economic reforms"
 korea.2.d: "[CHI.GetLeader] is urging our government to follow China's lead and initiate market liberalization reforms. While experiencing the same rapid economic growth as China did in the 1980s is a tempting proposition, we should weigh this against the instability that would inevitably result from our pursuit of such reforms."
 korea.2.a: "Now is not the time for reform!"
 korea.2.b: "Initiate minor reforms."
 korea.2.c: "Initiate moderate reforms."
 korea.2.e: "Initiate major reforms."
 korea.3.t: "[NKO.GetLeader] has announced fresh economic reforms"
 korea.3.d: "Under Chinese pressure to reform, North Korea has begun a process of economic liberalization that many hope will raise living standards in the \"hermit kingdom\". While many economists have lauded the beginning of this reform process, others have raised concerns about whether the speed of reform may cause instability in a country that has become adjusted to a completely planned economy."
 korea.3.a: "Encouraging news?"
 korea.4.t: "The Chinese-North Korean Split"
 korea.4.d: "Criticisms of [NKO.GetLeader]'s regime in Chinese government-linked media have increased dramatically in recent weeks. These criticisms have attacked North Korea's continued nuclear problem and the North Korean state's failure to improve the livelihoods of its citizens through economic liberalization as China has done in recent decades.\n\nWhile [CHI.GetLeader] has remained silent on the issue, it is widely believed that these media organizations would not have launched such a scathing critique of a once close ally without [CHI.GetLeader]'s tacit approval. Many observers see this as a culmination of Chinese frustration with the Kim dynasty, and possibly a desire for the establishment of an alternative government that is more stable and compliant with China's wishes."
 korea.4.a: "Only [CHI.GetLeader] knows where this going..."
 korea.5.t: "The Talks Begin"
 korea.5.d: "The primary demand of the North is that we cease our joint military exercises with the United States, exercises that they see as preparations for an invasion of their territory. However, these exercises are widely viewed by our military as necessary preparations in case of a North Korean attack. Agreeing to stop these exercises would therefore be a significant gamble, one where our country's security is put on the line."
 korea.5.d_NKO: "The primary demand of the South is that we cease our nuclear weapons tests, tests that they see as evidence of our aggressive intentions. However, our nuclear weapons program is viewed by the military as an important deterrent against US invasion. Moreover, the program and the tests that are necessary for its continuation help bolster the legitimacy of our government. Agreeing to stop these tests would therefore be a significant gamble, one where both our country and our government's security is put on the line."
 korea.5.a: "Our country will never be whole again unless we take a few risks..."
 korea.5.b: "Some risks are too big to take."
 korea.6.t: "Korean Peace Talks Begin"
 korea.6.d: "For over half a century North and South Korea have technically been in a state of war. This frozen conflict has occasionally heated up with clashes between the two sides along disputed maritime boundaries or across the DMZ. Now the two sides are coming together in the hope of bringing about an end to this state of affairs and achieve de-escalation on the Korean peninsula through a formal peace treaty. Negotiating a peace treaty is widely seen as an important first step towards reunifying the Korean peninsula."
 korea.6.a: "Can the two sides reach a compromise?"
 korea.7.t: "[CHI.GetLeader] Voices Support for Korean Reunification"
 korea.7.d: "China has historically been wary of the prospect of a united Korea aligned with the United States on its doorstep. Observers were therefore surprised to hear [CHI.GetLeader] voice unequivocal support for reunification, in a move that by some accounts has caught the North Korean leadership off guard. Given China's substantial influence in the Korean Peninsula, this announcement is likely to pressure the two sides to come to the negotiation table."
 korea.7.a: "Is change in the air?"
 korea.8.t: "Radical Korean Movement Gains Popularity"
 korea.8.d: "Economic inequality in the Republic of Korea has contributed to growing dissatisfaction among the country's lower classes. Thousands of online activists have begun calling for the greater equality through the establishment of community-level autonomy throughout the ROK. While the movement is leaderless and therefore lacks a central, clear message, the majority of its members seem to desire an abolition of the Korean state and the chaebols that it is tied to in favor of a system that distributes political and economic power among directly elected community-level representatives.\n\nThis new ideology, which rejects the foundational ideologies of both the ROK and the DPRK, represents a significant departure from the traditional politics of the South Korean radical left, which has either promoted leftist policies within South Korea's existing political system or called for the establishment of a North Korean-style state."
 korea.8.a: "Something is afoot in the ROK..."
 korea.9.t: "Rebels in the South Request Our Support"
 korea.9.d: "Representatives of the Korean National Liberation Movement seeking to overthrow the government in the South have come to us requesting an alliance so as to open up a new front along the DMZ."
 korea.9.a: "We will join their struggle!"
 korea.9.b: "We will watch from the sidelines."
 JUCHE_FACTION: "Korean Anti-Imperialist Front"
 korea.10.t: "South Korea requests that we end our protection of the North"
 korea.10.d: "For quite some time now South Korea has endeavored to show that it no longer a country beholden to US interests. Relations between our two countries are at an all-time high, while our relations with the North have stagnated for the most part. Now a South Korean delegation has come to request an end to the defense treaty between us and the North Koreans. If we agree to their request, we will no longer come to North Korea's aid in the event of an external invasion."
 korea.10.a: "We will stand by our allies!"
 korea.10.b: "The North is not worth our protection."
 korea.11.t: "Korean Arms Companies Offer Products"
 korea.11.d: "The Republic of Korea is well known for its ability to produce high-quality weaponry at relatively affordable prices. We should consider whether to purchase some of their equipment, but our funds are not limitless so we should choose wisely."
 korea.11.a: "Purchase Korean tanks."
 korea.11.b: "Purchase Korean self-propelled artillery."
 korea.11.c: "Purchase Korean trainer jets."
 korea.11.e: "Purchase Korean assault rifles."
 korea.11.f: "Refuse offer."

 korea.12.a: "Our international standing grows!"
 korea.13.t: "Beijing and Seoul Jointly Criticize Japanese WW2 Actions"
 korea.13.d: "In a rare move the governments of China and the Republic of Korea have issued a joint statement criticizing Japan's wartime actions and its subsequent refusal to fully atone for them. Many observers have interpreted this move as part of Seoul's efforts to woo China away from its support for North Korea. While Pyongyang has expressed support for the joint condemnation by [KOR.GetLeader] and [CHI.GetLeader], [NKO.GetLeader] is reportedly concerned about signs that China is increasingly favouring Seoul."
 korea.13.a: "We will never forget what they did."
 korea.13.b: "Their criticism is tiresome..."
 korea.13.c: "The past casts a long shadow..."
 korea.14.t: "China Annuls Defense Treaty with North Korea"
 korea.14.d: "Following the removal of US military presence from South Korea, China has agreed to withdraw from its defense treaty with North Korea, drawing furious condemnation from Pyongyang. The move follows a long series of moves by Seoul to win China's support and demonstrate its autonomy from Washington. Some have hypothesized that now that the way is clear for forceful reunification, [KOR.GetLeader] has decided to retake the North by force."
 korea.14.a: "Our efforts have paid off."
 korea.14.b: "We have tolerated Pyongyang for too long."
 korea.14.c: "Is war on the horizon?"
 korea.15.t: "[KOR.GetLeader] Demands Japanese Reparations"
 korea.15.d: "Following weeks of antagonistic rhetoric from Seoul and pressure by Korean activists, [KOR.GetLeader] has called upon Japan to pay reparations to survivors of Japanese war crimes committed during the Second World War. Japan, which maintains that the matter was settled between its government and that of South Korea during the rule of authoritarian strongman Park Chung-hee, has predictably refused to consider paying reparations.\n\nWhile the affair has failed to result in compensation for Korean victims, it has led to a strengthening of [KOR.GetLeader]'s political position with many Koreans rallying around this exceedingly emotive national cause."
 korea.15.a: "One day we will have justice."
 korea.15.b: "Their demands are absurd!"
 korea.15.c: "Can their disagreement be resolved?"
 korea.16.t: "War!"
 korea.16.d: "War has broken out between us and the North. As per our agreement with the United States, we must now hand over operational control of our armed forces to the US military."
 korea.16.a: "We must transfer control."
 korea.17.t: "The war is over"
 korea.17.d: "Peace has returned to the Korean peninsula. Now that we have returned to peacetime conditions, we can reassert control over our armed forces."
 korea.17.a: "Peace at last."
 korea.18.t: "National Assembly Elections Loom as Parties Begin Campaigning"
 korea.18.d: "With National Assembly elections coming up in about a month, we should begin boosting our party's popularity in order to facilitate a majority in the legislature for the next four years."
 korea.18.a: "Let's hope for a majority!"
 korea.21.t: "The results are in!"
 korea.21.a: "As always, it was a hard-fought election."
 korea.21.d_no: "Unfortunately, neither of the two main parties was able to gain a majority in the National Assembly. Our government will have to fight harder to win over legislators from other parties in order to pass controversial legislation."
 korea.21.d_con_loss: "Unfortunately, our party has failed to secure a majority in the National Assembly. Liberal lawmakers will refuse to pass any legislation that constrains trade unions, supports big business, or promotes antagonism to North Korea."
