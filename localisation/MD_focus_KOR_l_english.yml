 KOR_the_rok_armed_forces: "The ROK Armed Forces"
 KOR_the_rok_armed_forces_desc: "The Republic of Korea's existence is defined by its constant vulnerability. Clashes with the North are constant reminders of the threat that the DPRK poses to our citizens' security. Beyond the peninsula, we must remain vigilant against new and old enemies that would wish to do us harm. To guard against all such threats, our armed forces must be as strong as they possibly can be."
 KOR_foreign_procurement: "Foreign Procurement"
 KOR_foreign_procurement_desc: "While over the years we have developed a robust domestic arms industry, there are gaps in our indigenous capabilities that are better filled by equipment imported from abroad."
 KOR_p8_poseidon: "The P-8 Poseidon"
 KOR_p8_poseidon_desc: "It is time for our aging fleet of P-3Cs to be retired. These maritime patrol aircraft have only detected 28% of North Korean submarines involved in exercises, and therefore need to be replaced with newer models. The Boeing P-8 Poseidon was developed by the US to replace its own P-3Cs. It may be wise for us to follow the example of our strongest ally."
 KOR_c295: "The C-295"
 KOR_c295_desc: "It is time for our aging fleet of P-3Cs to be retired. These maritime patrol aircraft have only detected 28% of North Korean submarines involved in exercises, and therefore need to be replaced with newer models. The Spanish C-296 MPA is a significantly more affordable option than the P-8, but is generally considered an inferior aircraft."
 KOR_upgrade_f16s: "Upgrade F-16s"
 KOR_upgrade_f16s_desc: "Contracting Lockheed Martin to bring our F-16s up to the F-16V standard is an important stop-gap measure to maintain the effectiveness of our air force before we make the transition towards a a fifth generation fighter."
 KOR_order_f35s: "Order F-35s"
 KOR_order_f35s_desc: "It will be impossible for the Republic of Korea Air Force to match its more advanced rivals in the region without acquiring a fifth generation aircraft.

 KOR_blue_water_navy: "Towards a Blue Water Navy"
 KOR_blue_water_navy_desc: "While our navy has served us well in the past, in order to effectively defend our maritime sea lanes of communication in the 21st century we will need to start transitioning towards a blue-water navy."
 KOR_kss_program: "KSS Program"
 KOR_kss_program_desc: "The Korean Attack Submarine program is an important project that seeks up to build up the ROK Navy's domestic attack submarine capability. Now that our domestic manufacturers have learned from the technical know-how of German and Swedish submarine manufacturers, the time for an indigenous Korean submarine is upon us."
 KOR_ffx_program: "FFX Program"
 KOR_ffx_program_desc: "Guided missile frigates are a key part of the Republic of Korea's coastal defense. Regular clashes with the North Korean navy have proven the worth of these ships. As such we should invest time and money into the fleet of frigates that has defended our shores from hostile forces."
 KOR_kdx_program: "KDX Program"
 KOR_kdx_program_desc: "Our experimental destroyer program is a key part of our naval modernization effort.

 KOR_lpx_program: "LPX Program"
 KOR_lpx_program_desc: "Our amphibious landing ships are the pride and joy of our planned rapid response fleets, furthering the dream of an ROK Navy that has the ability to strike quickly and decisively across long distances. It is only by achieving a blue-water navy that we can guarantee the security of our territory, including the Dokdo islands after which the first of our LPX vessels is named."
 KOR_jeju_complex: "The Jeju Complex"
 KOR_jeju_complex_desc: "Jeju island's strategic position on the southern-most tip of the peninsula makes it the ideal location for an expanded naval base that can host our strategic mobile fleet.

 KOR_expand_dockyards: "Expand Dockyards"
 KOR_expand_dockyards_desc: "In order to reach our goal of a world-class 21st century navy, we must ensure that we have the capacity to build the necessary ships."

 KOR_ship_building_effort_desc: "By subsidizing our ship-building industry, we can accelerate the progress of our efforts to strengthen our navy."
 KOR_a_smart_navy: "A Smart Navy"
 KOR_a_smart_navy_desc: "The 21st century demands a navy that fully incorporates the most up-to-date technology available. By implementing ICT-based systems, our smart navy will become more adaptable and flexible than the ROK Navy's more sluggish and technologically inferior rivals."
 KOR_modernize_the_army: "Modernize the Army"
 KOR_modernize_the_army_desc: "The state of army is far from ideal. Despite being one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world, the equipment of the average Korean infantrymen is embarassingly old-fashioned. The demographic pressures of our low birth-rate must mean that we cannot rely on troop numbers alone to guarantee the ROK's security. Quality must be favored over quantity."

 KOR_conscription_policy: "Conscription Policy"
 KOR_conscription_policy_desc: "The issues that our army suffer from are not limited to outdated equipment alone.

 KOR_conscientious_objectors1_desc: "Every year hundreds of Korean men refuse to serve in the military due to their religious beliefs or other personal reasons.
