 AST_Final_Years_of_Howards_Second_Term: "Turbulent Times"
 AST_Final_Years_of_Howards_Second_Term_desc: "As Australia approaches the 2001 federal elections, John Howard is an unpopular prime minister, who many want to see resign or be voted out of office. There is also high dissatisfaction with the Liberal/National coalition. A big question on voters’ minds is if the country’s second biggest airline, Ansett Australia, should be bailed out. Labour supports a bailout because it would represent a significant loss of jobs, but the ruling coalition does not since they do not see it as the government’s fault."

 AST_The_Effects_of_GST: "The Effects of GST"
 AST_The_Effects_of_GST_desc: "A Goods and Services Tax, or a GST, is similar to what many Europeans would call a Value-Added Tax or (VAT). The Howard government passed legislation to establish a GST on 28 June 1999 as A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999. It gained assent on 8 July 1999 and came into operation on 1 July 2000. The government initially said that exemptions to GST were not possible, and hoped to pass the GST legislation with the support of independent Senator Harradine, but he ultimately voted against the legislation. However a compromise was eventually reached, involving most basic food items being exempt from GST, the GST on library purchases of books being refunded, a temporary 8% refund on school textbooks, increases to welfare payments, and greater powers to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission to oversee the implementation of the new tax regime."

Although they still currently lack representation in the House and lack meaningful representation in the Senate, leading up to the upcoming 2001 elections, as part of our campaigning for the election, and in general, it is good for the party to promote the idea of environmental consciousness to the Australian public."
 AST_grnInfluence_the_Unions: "Influence the Unions"
 AST_grnInfluence_the_Unions_desc: "Australia has a strong history of unions, dating back to the 1853 with the Amalgamated Engineering Union, which was formed in Sydney in 1852 by 27 members of the British union who had emigrated to Australia following a work stoppage initiated by the management of a company during a labour dispute, in Britain. It may be a good idea for the Green Party to work with the unions to establish popular support amongst union members and union supporters more generally for the Australian Greens, and also to establish potential donors from the unions and their members."

It is time that the Green Party investigates if there are firms that may form what economists call oligopolies in specific industries or across the economy, and break up “big business” if needed."
