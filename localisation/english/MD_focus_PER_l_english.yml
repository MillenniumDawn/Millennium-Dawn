Too fast.\n\nOmid screams again, “Iraqi aggressors!”. But it was too late. The flash of gunfire erupted into a blaze.\n\n Beside him, a young local militia boy hides from the oncoming fire.

 iranian_focus.116.d: "Over the past few weeks, donations have been flooding in from anonymous sources within Iran. It is speculated that these funds are directly given from the Iranian government, who seek to see the Republican Party prevail over the democratic party. This may be a subtle hint from the Iranian government that they seek favors from Republicans, as they are doing them one."
 iranian_focus.116.a: "Okay"
 iranian_focus.117.t: "Iran Requests Assistance With Aging F-14 Fleet"
 iranian_focus.117.d: "The Iranian government has come to us asking for assistance in upgrading their aging F-14 fleet. The Iranian Air Force officers who were present gave an interesting pitch and proposals. The Iranians would fund the creation of a modern F-14 variant which would aim at upgrading Iran's old and aging fleet of F-14's. This variant could also be used by us, and our own Air Force."

 iranian_focus.120.t: "A Movement for Freedom"
 iranian_focus.120.d: "Being established before the Revolution, the Freedom Movement of Iran has been at the forefront of fighting non-Republican institutions. Being early supporters of the Islamic Republic and revolution, the Freedom Movement has shifted over the years to opposing the Islamic Republic in its entirety, and pushing for a Republic. With the rise of the FMI, Iranian's may finally be able to establish a true Islamic-Democracy."

 iranian_focus.121.t: "The Green Banner of Hope"
 iranian_focus.121.d: "Led by Mir-Hossein Mousavi, the Green Path of Hope has shaped to be a more conservative alternative to the Freedom Movement of Iran. Although sharing a common goal in establishing a Republic, Mousavi has played a major role in shaping the Islamic Republic and its policies. Regardless of his past, Mousavi has now shifted to be more socially liberal, whilst also emphasizing the need for preserving some of the ideals of the Islamic Revolution."

First losing it once Mossadegh was in charge, and then a second time in 1979 when Shapour Bakhtiar worked towards establishing a democracy following the collapse of the Imperial State. In modern times, the National Front represents more of a socialist-technocratic ideology. Regardless of their previous luck in holding power, the National Front has a vision that no other organization does."

 iranian_focus.123.d: "Our party had arranged for a formal meeting between our top leadership and KDPI leadership. In this meeting, a coalition of sorts was discussed, in which the Pan-Iranist party would fund KDPI development projects in exchange for the KDPI to declare the Pan-Iranist government as the legal and legitimate government of the Kurdish regions. Meeting their demands will allow for us to leverage some nice benefits from the Kurds in the West."

 iranian_focus.124.t: "Restrictions on the Baha'i Population"
 iranian_focus.124.d: "As a result of previous Islamic Republic regulations, the Baha'i have been subject to discrimination which prevented them from participating in society. As fellow human beings, they deserve the most basic of rights, which the Ulema do not see fit. Moving to grant these rights would undermine the Ulema, and seriously anger them, but at least we may preserve the nations dignity."

His reforms are said to have paved the way for a new government, one free of the corruption that was once part of the Islamic Republic. With his reforms, a series of parties have been able to campaign and garner support over the past few months.

This marks a historic moment, as Iran sheds its old identity and moves towards a new, and more democratic form of government. The Ayatollah will remain as a key figure in government and politics to moderate and protect the state, while political parties will be free to run and hold office. There are concerns however, of Montazeri's ailing health, and the possible question of succession upon his death. For now, Iranians are free to express their political opinions freely."

 iranian_focus.130.t: "The Middle Man"
 iranian_focus.130.d: "A former army officer, politician, and academic. Those three words are what create the core characteristics of Ghalibaf. Perhaps being best known for his several attempts at winning the Iranian presidency, or the oligarchic tendencies he has, Ghalibaf has always positioned himself as the middle man. If an opportunity presented itself, Ghalibaf would be there to take it. He is both a principalist and a reformist, and his next moves are usually not known, unless there is money involved."
 iranian_focus.130.a: "Things will be done"
 iranian_focus.131.t: "The Ambitions of Ahmadinejad"
 iranian_focus.131.d: "Historically Ahmadinejad has been touted as a principalist, one of the most hardcore that there ever was. However, this conservative image of his is deemed by many as false, and instead some consider him as politically confused. This unclear position has had its benefits, as he has benefited from increased support from rural areas due to his religious affiliation, and more urban areas due to his more nationalistic tendencies. Nonetheless, Ahmadinejad remains an islamist principalist with the interests of Shia's in mind."

 iranian_focus.132.t: "Iran Calls for Russian Investors"
 iranian_focus.132.d: "The Iranian government has put out an announcement today calling for 'those who seek to multiply their wealth in Russia to come to Iran'. This announcement suggests that Iran is looking for Russian investments into the Iranian state. Our government has also been considering this as a sign, one that may entail benefits for us too. If we are able to secure our influence in Iran, we may be able to do much more than just talk over diplomatic channels."

 iranian_focus.134.a: "Quite unfortunate"
 iranian_focus.135.t: "Preservation of the Revolution"
 iranian_focus.135.d: "Top leadership is debating on how we could preserve the revolution and its ideals. There is fear that the initial hatred for the former government will wear off soon, and with that, the peoples anger will be directed at us. We must quickly identify a method to keep people on the governments side, and save ourselves from collapse."

 iranian_focus.136.d: "Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei has been fighting to win over the support of the Iranian establishment for the longest time, but his unique political ideology continues to alienate him and his supporters. Believing that an Iranian School of Islam is needed, Mashaei consistently angers the Shi'ite Clergy who he seeks to cast out from Iranian society. On the other hand, his association with figures such as Ahmadinejad puts him at odds with Reformist movements. Still, his secular ideology and nationalistic tendencies has brought him support from the gray area within Iranian politics."
 iranian_focus.136.a: "The Islam of the Iranians is different and enlightening, it will shape the future"
 iranian_focus.137.t: "An Army of the People"
 iranian_focus.137.d: "The Iranian Armed Forces, or the Artesh, have historically been apolitical. However, rising instability within the political establishment has left them no choice but to intervene directly and create a more stable order until the situation calms down and is ready to return to normal once more. The political direction of the Artesh is yet to be fully known, as it is made up of all sectors of Iranian society due to the majority of the active servicemen being of conscript origin."
 iranian_focus.137.a: "May the Army be sacrificed for the nation"
 iranian_focus.138.t: "Between Red and Blue"
 iranian_focus.138.d: "Ahmadinejads official stance on economics has always been bleak, and it is known by no one but god. This has caused much trouble in the cabinet, and calls are increasing for Ahmadinejad and his government to take a formal stance on whether the direction of the government will be one that leans towards socialism, or capitalism."

 iranian_focus.140.d: "Earlier today, Ahmadinejad was seen pondering heavily, completely lost in his thoughts. After he was approached and asked what he was thinking about all day, he responded with 'the money we spend on the troops'. The money he is referring to is from donations for various veterans charities across Iran. Concerned with where the money was being allocated, Ahmadinejad has been debating whether to just keep the money and spend it elsewhere, or to let the money go where it was supposed to."

 iranian_focus.140.b: "We must resist the urge, just as we have been guided by religion"
 iranian_focus.141.t: "Spiting the Clergy"
 iranian_focus.141.d: "To spite the mostly dominant Shi'ite clergy in the nation, we have the ability to rename some of our cities and provinces to Pre-Islamic names. Though this move would certainly anger the clerics, it will not topple their influence like we would want. Instead, this move could be considered an opening to a much grander movement to replace the clergy with God and only God himself."
 iranian_focus.141.a: "Move forward with the plan"
 iranian_focus.141.b: "We cannot risk angering the religious zealots"
 iranian_focus.142.t: "Old Habits Die Hard"
 iranian_focus.142.d: "Exposed of much corruption in his political career, Mashaei has not shyed away from any potential opportunity that could fill his pockets quick. However, now that he is in charge of the government and effectively the leader of the nation, his ways must change. If he is to properly implement his policies, then his old habits must be tossed out in favor of more ethical ones."

 iranian_focus.142.b: "Corruption is for bad men, it must be eradicated"
 iranian_focus.143.t: "The Iranian Schism"
 iranian_focus.143.d: "The Iranian government has begun reforming how Islam is fundementally practiced. With most Muslim states, including ours, putting the Ulema and clerics in a high position, Iran is moving to dissolve the participation of the clergy in Islamic matters. They are dubbing this as the 'Iranian School' of Islam, and it's ideas have spread to our own country."
 iranian_focus.143.a: "This cannot be good"
 iranian_focus.144.t: "Iranian Trade Agreement Proposal"
 iranian_focus.144.d: "The Iranian government has proposed a possible trade agreement between our two nations. This news has come as a shock to many in our cabinet, as the current Iranian government is being headed by several former Islamic Republic officials, including their leader. Nonetheless, this shift in diplomacy is a good one, at least for us."

 iranian_events.201.d: "Our security forces were dealt a major blow in our recent attempts to crack down, having suffered some casualties when faced with angry rioters. This setback will only be temporary, and it is only a matter of time until we are ready to move in again."
 iranian_events.201.a: "Okay"
 iranian_events.202.t: "Protests Slow Down"
 iranian_events.202.d: "After weeks of protesting, it appears people are tiring of shouting into the streets with very little results. Far less people are showing up, and the rioters have been reduced to a small group of dedicated protesters."
 iranian_events.202.a: "As was expected"
 iranian_events.220.t: "The Breaking Point"
 iranian_events.220.d: "For weeks now, opposition groups have been building up steam and anticipation for today. The goal of the opposition is simple; storm the Seda va Sima broadcasting station and declare the Islamic Republic as illegitimate. About 1,000,000 people are to march towards Valiasr street in Tehran, and security forces are fearing that they would simply not be able to stop that many people. As a result, several high ranking Artesh and IRGC officials are said to be negotiating behind closed doors with the opposition groups to secure the safety of their positions and their comrades."

 iranian_events.221.d: "Several generals and high ranking officers within the Artesh have begun publicly denouncing the government, even going so far as to support the new movement that is forming against the government. One of the more prominent units of the army, the 65th Airborne Special Forces Brigade, also known as the NOHED brigade, have removed the insignia of the Islamic from their uniforms and military equipment. Such developments have created fear of a potential military coup or intervention against the government. Several units of the Artesh, including the NOHED brigade, have refused orders to assist with cracking down on the movement."

 iranian_events.222.d: "As the legitimacy of the regime comes under greater scrutiny, several MP's and ministers across the nation have begun resigning as a subtle sign of defiance. Whilst some are taking a more silent approach, there are those who have began calling for an outright referendum, particularly those in the technocratic and reformist camps. Regardless, these voices have only added more fuel to the fire that we are seemingly unable to put out.."

 iranian_events.223.t: "The Rise of Montazeri"
 iranian_events.223.d: "Being quite popular amongst Reformists and Democrats, Ayatollah Montazeri is being called upon to lead a revolutionary care-taker government to see through a peaceful transition of power into a better institution of democratic rule. Montazeri is being seen as the ideal candidate for such a position due to his popularity amongst both Muslims and Secularists, thus allowing for a unified resistance movement to continue."

 iranian_events.223.b: "Let him be"
 iranian_events.224.t: "Formation of the Revolutionary Council of Iran"
 iranian_events.224.d: "Earlier today, a huge crowd gathered around the Tomb of Cyrus the Great, the founder of Iran. The reason for the gathering was to listen to the speech of a former minister, who is now a spokesperson for the newly formed Revolutionary Council of Iran. It has been understood that at the gathering, the revolutionary council declared that they would not be afraid to use force against the regime and its security forces who try and 'stop the will of the Iranian people'. Such a threat has not been taken lightly by elements in the IRGC, as tensions continue to mount."
 iranian_events.224.a: "Order the IRGC to be ready"
 iranian_events.224.b: "We can do nothing but watch"
 iranian_events.225.t: "The Fall of Tehran"
 iranian_events.225.d: "Protesters and revolutionaries today stormed several government buildings, taking down portraits of Ayatollah Khomeini and Khamenei, and chanting anti-government slogans from the windows of the same buildings. In a fierce speech today, Ayatollah [PER.GetLeader] denounced those partaking in the demonstrations as agents of Israel and America, and promising to pardon those involved with the protests if they would just return home. However, his speech fell on deaf ears, and the cries on the street continue to get louder and louder."

 iranian_events.226.d: "In the early hours of this morning, the office of the Supreme Leader announced a temporary relocation of the government to somewhere 'outside of the honorable borders of Iran'. To many in the streets, this was the Islamic Republics way of formally resigning. After decades of rule, the Islamic Republic has finally lost its grip on power. The people have flooded the streets, toppling monuments, tearing down portraits, and celebrating. The corridors of power lay dormant, with whatever comes next being unwritten."

 iranian_events.227.d: "Perhaps to flee persecution, judgement, or shame, most of the high command of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp have fled to Southern Lebanon, with the most loyal pockets of men fleeing to the Eastern country side."
 iranian_events.227.a: "Cowards"
 iranian_events.228.t: "Artillery Bombards Artesh Positions in Eastern Iran"
 iranian_events.228.d: "Explosions woke up locals in several cities in the east today, with Artesh positions coming under heavy bombardment, especially in Mashhad, Kerman, and Yazd. Following the first wave of initial attacks, Qasem Soleimani appeared in front of a crowd in the Imam Reza Mosque announcing that 'today, the mistakes that were made just a few weeks ago will be reversed', referring to the relocation of the Islamic Republic government. It appears the IRGC elements that fled towards the East of the country were able to regroup, and rebuild a force strong enough to push the Artesh back. Nonetheless, this will be nothing but a temporary set back."
 iranian_events.228.a: "'The blood of brave men was shed like unto the shedding of rain from a black cloud' §H- Ferdowsi§!"

 iranian_events.229.t: "Fighting Erupts in Eastern Iran"
 iranian_events.229.d: "Reports of heavy gunfire have been recorded in Eastern Iran, with the army coming under heavy fire by insurgents. The insurgents in question appear to be former IRGC units and officers who have rallied under General Qassem Soleimani in hopes of overthrowing the recently established government. Though the government of Iran has announced that the conflict will come to a swift end, stating that 'the government of Iran and the people of Iran trust the army to restore the integrity of Irans borders and oust the traitors trying to destroy it'. While these claims seem to have assured some people, others are fearing that the IRGC will be able to overthrow the government, possibly ushering in a regime more hardline than that of the original Islamic Republic."
 iranian_events.229.a: "Another revolution in ruins"
 iranian_events.230.t: "Nationwide Protests Erupt in Iran"
 iranian_events.230.d: "Following incredibly unpopular government decisions by the Iranian Government earlier this week, the Iranian people have taken to the streets in droves to voice their opposition to the government and its decisions. Though some are speculating that the protests will die soon, following a common trend in Iranian uprisings, others are stating that this time around the protests could potentially lead to the toppling of the Islamic Republic system which was established through street protests like that of those that are being witnessed today. Nonetheless, the government has already began its crackdown on protesters, and videos circulating on the internet show that the security forces are not taking this movement lightly."
 iranian_events.230.a: "Interesting"
 iranian_events.231.t: "Collapse of the Islamic Republic"
 iranian_events.231.d: "In the early hours of this morning, the office of the Supreme Leader announced a temporary relocation of the government to somewhere 'outside of the honorable borders of Iran'. To many in the streets of Iran, this was the Islamic Republics way of formally resigning. After decades of rule, the Islamic Republic has finally lost its grip on power. The people of Iran have flooded the streets, toppling monuments, tearing down portraits, and celebrating. The corridors of power lay dormant, with whatever comes next being unwritten. However, what is known, is that the united Iranian opposition are looking towards a democratic form of governance, one that was promised by the Islamic Republic in 1979 but never delivered upon."
 iranian_events.231.a: "What happens next?"
 iranian_events.232.t: "Increased Calls For the Government to Resign From Opposition"
 iranian_events.232.d: "There have been increased calls for the government to resign and step down by various opposition groups. Groups ranging from the left to the right have managed to put aside their differences as a result of the insurgency in the East of the country, with many of the opposition leaders fearing for their life as a result of the advances made by former elements of the regime. It is now up to the government to determine whether or not it is appropiate to resign."
 iranian_events.232.a: "Resign, and hand it over to former heads of state"
 iranian_events.232.b: "Resign, and hand it over to the monarchists"
 iranian_events.232.c: "Resign, and hand it over to the leftists"
 iranian_events.232.d1: "The government will never resign!"
 iranian_events.233.t: "Remnants of the Fallen Regime"
 iranian_events.233.d: "With the fall of the Islamic Republic, many former government officials and affiliates saw an opportunity to capitilize on their experience in order to seize power for themselves. This includes figures such as Ahmadinejad, Mashaei, and Ghalibaf. In addition to them, the army has also began increasing its voice in the government to further their own interests. It is now time to choose who we want to lead the nation following our resignation."
 iranian_events.233.a: "Call on Ahmadinejad - Only the IRGC can defeat the IRGC"
 iranian_events.233.b: "Call on Ghalibaf - The Oligarch and a man of bussiness"
 iranian_events.233.c: "Call on Mashaei - The patriot who wants an Iranian school of Islam"
 iranian_events.233.d1: "Call on the Artesh - The national army"
 iranian_events.234.t: "The Heirs of Cyrus"
 iranian_events.234.d: "Iranian Shahdoms led the nation for over 2,500 years prior to the Islamic Revolution in 1979. It is for this reason that the Pahlavi dynasty has experienced relative popularity even following their overthrow in the Islamic Revolution. However, the Pan-Iranists are also monarchists to a lesser extent, and they also wish to unify the lands that were lost to the great powers. Either way, we must pick one group to hand power to once we formally resign."
 iranian_events.234.a: "The Constitutionalists - Followers of Reza Pahlavi"
 iranian_events.234.b: "The Pan-Iranists - Who seek to re-unite Irans lost territory"
 iranian_events.235.t: "Voice of the Workers"
 iranian_events.235.d: "The Islamic Revolution was not entirely an Islamic revolution, but rather it encompassed a broad spectrum of political ideologies. The second largest being socialist and left-wing revolutionaries, they were cheated out of a say in the government following purges by Khomeini in the 80's. Either way, a socialist government will ensure good relations amongst the government and bazaars once we resign."
 iranian_events.235.a: "The MEK - Though unpopular, organized"
 iranian_events.235.b: "The Worker-Communist Party - Known most for their ability to organize unions"
 iranian_events.236.t: "IRGC Collapses"
 iranian_events.236.d: "After weeks of heavy fighting, the IRGC have decided to lay down their arms and retreat to the country side and neighboring countries, with many choosing to go to Southern Lebanon through a secret corridor. However their cowardice is not important at this time, what matters most is that the revolution and its people have achieved ultimate victory."
 iranian_events.236.a: "As was expected"
 iranian_events.237.t: "Ayatollah Montazeri's National Address"
 iranian_events.237.d: "Stepping in front of possibly one of the largest crowds in Iranian history, perhaps larger than the ones that Ayatollah Khomeini drew, Montazeri began to wave to the crowd in front of him. Ayatollah Montazeri began his speech with a prayer, and then following it up with promises to dismantle the 'corrupt, abusive, and un-islamic institutions of the previous regime'. This statement drew loud cheers from the crowd. The 20 minute speech was televised to the whole nation, with people who were watching from home chanting pro-Montazeri out of their windows. Though so far only promises have been made, many are optimistic about the changes being promised by Ayatollah Montazeri. However, only time will tell whether or not he follows up with his promises of bringing about a new, free, and democratic Iran."
 iranian_events.237.a: "May God be with Iran"
 iranian_events.238.t: "Moderate-Liberal Islam On The Rise"
 iranian_events.238.d: "With the ascension of Ayatollah Montazeri and his followers, many liberals and moderates have begun praising the new government for bringing swift, and much needed social reform to the nation. Though the road ahead is still quite long, support for moderate and liberal forms of Islamic governance are on the rise. Party's like the Green Path Of Hope and The Freedom Movement have begun enjoying newly found support as a result of the shift in Iranian politics. Regardless though, there are still fears of a potential rise in nationalistic sentiment, especially amongst those in what has been dubbed as the 'deviant current'."
 iranian_events.238.a: "Let us see what happens"
 iranian_events.239.t: "Khatami And Rafsanjani Break Silence"
 iranian_events.239.d: "Following the collapse of the Islamic Republic, many prominent reformists who took an active part in governing the Islamic Republic went silent. Two individuals in particular, Khatami and Rafsanjani, were especially silent. Mohammad Khatami has been labeled as a traitor to the Reformist movement by many students groups, as they feel betrayed that he did not side with them on both occasions that they protested against the government. They also feel that he failed to deliver what he campaigned on, democracy in Iran. Rafsanjani has also been labeled as a government stooge, and soemone that also failed to bring democracy to Iran. However, in the early hours of the morning, both Khatami and Rafsanjani appeared before a crowd stating that they are willing to return to politics with the blessings of the new government."

 iranian_events.241.d: "The MEK has sabotaged several industrial sectors throughout the nation, though most being unsuccessful, there were some states where the effects more noticeable than others.

 iranian_events.243.t: "The MEK Meets With Foreign Leaders"
 iranian_events.243.d: "The MEK has met with several diplomats from a foreign country today, with the nation being of higher international prestige. This high level meeting was done in a bid to gain them more legitimacy in the political scene, both in and outside of Iran."
 iranian_events.243.a: "We won't forget this"
 iranian_events.244.t: "MEK Call For Nationwide Strikes"
 iranian_events.244.d: "The MEK have called for nationwide strikes, especially throughout regions with more minorities living in them. Though the strikes are expected to end soon, the impacts of the strikes will have a lasting impact on the nation."
 iranian_events.244.a: "Okay"
 iranian_events.245.t: "MEK Call For Nationwide Protests"
 iranian_events.245.d: "The MEK have called for nationwide protests, and have been somehow successful in doing so to some extent. We will have the ability to suppress these protests, but at a large cost. Eitherway, this is a sign that our popularity has fallen too low."
 iranian_events.245.a: "Do nothing"

 iranian_events.246.t: "The MEK Attempts Assassination On a High Ranking General"
 iranian_events.246.d: "The MEK have attempted to assassinate a high ranking general, and were successful to some degree, as the general in question is now in critical condition and fighting for his life at the moment. We have the ability to save his life, though it will be quite costly."
 iranian_events.246.a: "May his soul rest in peace"

 iranian_events.247.t: "Hatred Against the MEK Grows"
 iranian_events.247.d: "It appears that hatred against the MEK has risen amongst our people, and the cult-like group has fallen in popularity amongst some of its members. We accredit such societal progress to our governments ability at achieving excellence in all aspects of life."

 iranian_events.249.t: "Patriotism On the Rise Amongst Workers"
 iranian_events.249.d: "Our workers have begun working with additional vigor following fears of MEK growth. This is most likely because they have realized their lives could be even worse, and thus, they wish to keep the MEk as far as possible from any and all modes of power. "

 iranian_events.251.t: "The MEK Denounced As Foreign Terrorist Organization"
 iranian_events.251.d: "Recently, some countries have begun designating the MEK as a foreign terrorist organization.

This is a big step forward to rooting these roaches out of our society."
 iranian_events.251.a: "Good"
 iranian_events.252.t: "The Iranian Government Collapses"
 iranian_events.252.d: "In an unexpected turn of events, the Iranian government had announced its dissolution and surrendering of power. As a result, the People's Mojahedin Organization has assumed control of Tehran, and will be leading Iran moving forward. Though it is unknown why the Iranian government had decided to make such a move, it is widely understood that many, including the Ayatollah, feared assassination from the organization. It can then be inferred that the move was done to save the lives of several top government officials from being taken by the organization. Nonetheless, the move comes as a shock to many in the region, and the world."

 iranian_events.253.d: "The Iranian government has declared total victory over the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran following the assassination of the Rajavi family. The family in question, has been accused of running a cult-like organization since the late 60's. The PMOI (MEK) were also complicit in assisting Ba'athist Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980's, thus making their rivalry with the Iranian government, and many Iranians, a fierce one. Nonetheless, the Iranian governments ability to assassinate the family and key organization leaders from abroad has shocked many around the world and inside of Iran."

 nuclear_iran.14.d: "The Iranian government has come forth with documents, photos, and other evidence proving that they currently possess the capability to produce nuclear weapons, if they don't already have them at hand. Our administration is quite perplexed by this move, as the world has speculated that the Iranians have been trying to produce nuclear weapons for some time now, with claims of this being denied by Iran. However it is suspected that Iran is doing this as a way to blackmail us and the rest of the world into giving them benefits that we otherwise would not grant them. Regardless, we will need to lift sanctions on them, and whether we do it on our own terms or theirs will still need to be decided."
 nuclear_iran.14.a: "Fine, what do they want?"
 nuclear_iran.14.b: "We will stand firm, they must dismantle all nuclear capabilities!"
 nuclear_iran.15.t: "United States Demands the Dismantling of All Nuclear Facilities and Weapons"
 nuclear_iran.15.d: "The United States has responded to our more than reasonable, and logical proposal of negotiation with a threat. They have demanded that we dismantle all of our nuclear weapons technology, as well as comply with the terms of the IAEA. However, the United States has offered to lift sanctions if we do decide to cooperate with them, but this is just not the way we expected them to react."

 nuclear_iran.16.t: "Iran Complies"
 nuclear_iran.16.d: "The Iranian government has agreed to comply with our terms on the matter of nuclear weapons. They will have exactly 6 months to de-nuclearize their nation, which includes changing their doctrine and destroying any and all stockpiles of nuclear weapons if they have any."
 nuclear_iran.16.a: "Good"
 nuclear_iran.17.t: "Iran Rebuffs Our Terms"
 nuclear_iran.17.d: "The Iranian government has decided that it wants to play with fire, and has decided that it wants to reject our generous offer. As a result, we will be able to pursue several options at hand, from sanctions to outright intervention."
 nuclear_iran.17.a: "Sanctions on their industries, and key persons of interest"
 nuclear_iran.17.b: "Sanctions, and military intervention against their facilities!"
 nuclear_iran.17.c: "We should just leave them alone"
 nuclear_iran.18.t: "United States Calls for Intervention Against Iran"
 nuclear_iran.18.d: "The United States has recently declared the Iran has crossed a redline that it should not have. This is primarily because of the discovery of the Iranian nuclear program, and its refusal to comply with the United States terms. We are asked to sanction the Iranian regime, and assist with pressuring Iran into pressure."

 nuclear_iran.20.t: "Iranian Nuclear Program Exposed"

 nuclear_iran.21.d: "Following the exposure of our nuclear program, the United States has declared that we need to rid the state of all nuclear weaponary and get back to the negotiating table in order to get the sanctions that we currently have on our government removed."
 nuclear_iran.21.a: "We will see"
 nuclear_iran.22.t: "Iran Offers Cheap Oil"
 nuclear_iran.22.d: "Iran has offered its oil to us at a discounted price. This is as a result of crippling sanctions placed upon them by Western powers, and their friends. This has crippled Irans economy, and as a result, they are forced to sell off their oil at a cheaper price."

 nuclear_iran.22.b: "No"
 nuclear_iran.23.t: "China Buys Our Oil!"

 nuclear_iran.25.a: "We will resist!"
 nuclear_iran.26.t: "United States Decreases Economic Pressure"
 nuclear_iran.26.d: "The United States has chosen that it wants to decrease the amount of sanctions they have put on our people. Whether they maintain this stance is something that we will have to wait and see."
 nuclear_iran.26.a: "Good"
 nuclear_iran.27.t: "Iran Begins Acting Erratically"
 nuclear_iran.27.d: "Iran has once more began acting more like a pariah state instead of a civilized one. We must reconsider our stance on sanctions."
 nuclear_iran.27.a: "They asked for it"
 nuclear_iran.28.t: "Iran Falls in Line"
 nuclear_iran.28.d: "In a complete 180 of typical Iranian policy, they appear to be moving towards a more peaceful and controlled direction."
 nuclear_iran.28.a: "Good, maybe we can ease sanctions now"
 nuclear_iran.29.t: "The United States Lifts Sanctions!"
 nuclear_iran.29.d: "The day has come, President [USA.GetLeader] announced that they would be lifting all economic sanctions against our nation. This is a day we have long awaited, and our dreams have finally come. The time has come for us to put aside our differences, and reconcile with the Americans."
 nuclear_iran.29.a: "A great day"

 # Leader Descriptions
 PER_khamenei_desc: "Khamenei was born in 1939 in Mashhad to a family of Azeri descent. The future Ayatollah chose to focus on theology, studying under influential clerics such as Khomeini. By the 60's and 70's, Khamenei was active against the Shah and fell in trouble with the SAVAK, being arrested as a result. After the Islamic revolution, he chose to help with the war effort against the Iraqi invasion, and participated in mobilizing people to defend the nation. Khamenei was active in shaping the new government, eventually being elected as the 3rd president of the Islamic Republic. Following the disinheritence of Montazeri, Khamenei was the chosen successor to Ayatollah Khomeini. Though still incredibly conservative, some consider Khamenei as a reformist in comparison to Khomeini, as he chose to lift many restrictions placed on things such as music following the 1979 revolution. He is also known for his tampering of politics, where if one camp grows too strong he tries to strengthen the other."
 PER_mashaei_desc: "Born in Mazandaran, Mashaei played a role in quelling the 1979 Kurdish revolt following the Iranian Revolution. Being a former intelligence officer during this conflict, Mashaei was able to meet individuals such as Ahmadinejad whom he became friends with, later allowing him to catapult his political career into the spotlight. Holding relatively unorthodox views in comparison to other Iranian Principalists, Mashaei believes that the clergy has grown too strong and must be weakened in Iranian society, both religiously and politically. Wanting to bring about a mix of Islamic Nationalism and Pre-Islamic Iranian nationalism, Mashaei and his clique are labeled by the Clergy as an individual with 'Deviant Tendancies'."
 PER_montazeri_desc: "Born in Najafabad, Isfahan, Montazeri was educated by a Grand Marja, one of the highest authorities in Shia islam. Montazeri was also one of the leaders of the Islamic Revolution that toppled the Shah in 1979. As a Grand Ayatollah, Montazeri was appointed as the successor to Ayatollah Khomeini upon his death. However, things took a different turn, and the revolution did not play out to what Montazeri had invisioned. Instead of a democracy which included all sectors of Iranian politics, there were hand picked and vetted individuals. Certain groups were prohibited from running or participating in election, and many parties were banned. Following the 1988 mass execution of various leftists in Iran, Montazeri spoke out in opposition to the government and criticized Khomeini's actions, thus resulting in him being disinherited by Khomeini. Ever since, Montazeri actively worked against the regime and called for its toppling, calling for the construction of a new non-islamic regime."
 PER_pahlavi_desc: "Born in Tehran as the Crown Prince, and heir to the Peacock throne, Reza experienced a life of royalty in his early years. Often being a moderate in comparison to his father, taking steps such as pardoning enemies of the state or calling for more liberal changes, Reza did not directly inherit the throne. While he was in the United States, training to become a fighter jet pilot, the Islamic Revolution of 1979 ousted his father, and a 2,500 year tradition of Iranian Shahdoms. With the collapse of the Imperial State of Iran, Reza had no choice but to stay in the United States and live a life of exile. Many of his supporters inside of Iran chose to flee to other western states, such as those in Europe or the Americas. He did not entirely abandon all hope for the throne, as until the mid 1980's, he was receiving funding from the CIA to pursue activities against the Islamic Republic. This all ended following the Iran Contra affair. This did not spell the end of his resolve of overthrowing the Islamic Republic, instead Reza focused on uniting Iranians through campaigns of resistance against the Islamic Republic, in a bid to overthrow it."
 PER_homayoon_desc: "Born on the 27th of September, 1928, Homayoon began his political activities at the young age of fourteen. Being a part of several political parties and movements, he was an early supporter of Mohammad Mossadegh. His political involvement was not limited to just Mossadegh, as he was involved in SUMKA, the fascist party which was led by a former member of the S.S., Monshizadeh. Homayoon was also involved with several Pan-Iranist organizations, and his political leanings eventually starting leaning right. He eventually became the minister of Information and Tourism, which allowed him to gain enough favor with the Imperial State to become the deputy secratery general of the Rastakhiz party, the state party of Iran in the 70's. Following the revolution, Homayoon fled to France, where he pursued activities against the Islamic Republic. Homayoon seeked to create a liberal order in Iran, and thus helped found the Constitutionalist Party of Iran, which aimed to restore a constitutional monarchy under Reza Pahlavi II. This did not mean Homayoon was a staunch monarchist, or supporter of Pahlavi, as there had been instances of criticisms aimed at Pahlavi by Homayoon."

# Ideas for Separatism systems
 # Based on the influence of the following nations, they will get decisions to launch fully-armed uprisings that will have a mission activate which will give Iran a limited time quell it. If it fails to do so in a timely manner, a peace deal will be forced, else Iran will receive increased sanctions if it keeps fighting. May even lose the core(s).
 # Saudi's - Insurrections in Arabistan
 # Turkey/Azerbaijan - Insurrections in Azerbaijan (Iranian)
 # Israel - Insurrection in Kordestan
 # These will be visible as state modifiers, influencing nations will get an event letting them know it's possible

# Ideas for protest system
# - Protests can come from events, focuses, etc. They will be scripted
# - Although the events will be scripted, the actual protests will not be
# - Before a protest breaks out, depending on the scale, it will be assigned 3 tiers
# - Tier 1 is small, regional protest
# - Tier 2 is a medium, regional protest that can grow to a tier 3
# - Tier 3 is a large, revolutionary movement that can topple the government
# - If more than 12 states fall, the government could resign
# - Each time a state falls, the balance of power moves closer to collapse
# - State will fall at random
# - To resolve a protest, you need to deploy security forces
# - Success from security forces will be based on army internal faction opinion
# - Lower opinion will mean lower chance of success
# - If I.R. collapses on the BOP, then an event chain where the government falls starts

# Ideas for MEK mechanic
# Will have 3 phases based on government popularity & support
# Phase 1 - high government popularity/legitimacy will mean the MEK will not do a whole lot, and if you locate where their base is, you can sabotage them out of their host country
# Phase 2 - Medium government popularity/legitimacy will mean the MEK will try and assassinate scientists, generals, sabotage factories, etc
# Phase 3 - Low government popularity/legitimacy will mean the MEK will try and start nationwide protests, support Kurdish independence, and attempt coups
