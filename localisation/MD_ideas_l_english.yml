After the creation of Israel, Palestinian groups and even individuals have launched attacks against Israeli interests, a phenomenon that has persisted despite the signing of the Oslo Accords. This has been due to widespread Palestinian dissatisfaction about the continuing construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Israel's refusal to share control of Jerusalem among other grievances. These attacks have contributed to a sense of Israeli insecurity and support for hardline political forces."

This event saw a mass exodus of the Palestinian population from Israeli-controlled territory, leading to the establishment of large refugee camps in neighboring Arab countries. These refugees live a precarious existence, as many governments have not granted citizenship to Palestinian refugees, thereby often denying them of the right to work and access public services. These refugees yearn to return to the homes that their families owned prior to 1948, producing a difficult issue to resolve given the fact that much of the land formerly owned by these refugees is now inhabited by Israelis."

With huge government bailouts to prop up key enterprises and banks, the response to the crisis built up one of the largest public debts in the world. The bad business environment in Japan leads Japanese corporations to invest very little inside of Japan, with profits instead put into abroad or government bonds to sustain the huge debt. Due to deflation, the rise in the value of the Yen, this gives stable profits for savers even with minuscule or negative interest rates, leaving no incentives to consume or invest in the real economy. This deflation allows Japan to sustain huge debts that would make any other country bankrupt. Unfortunately, it also ensures anemic economic growth with no solution in sight."

Burundi is dominated by the Tutsi and committed a genocide against the Hutu in 1972, whereas Rwanda is dominated by the Hutu and had thousands of Tutsis slaughtered by Hutu militias in 1994.\n\nThese two ethnic groups just seem to not get along, but have been forced into the same countries by the European-created colonial borders."

 austrian_neutrality_desc:0 "After seeing the partition of Germany into two states in 1949, the Austrians looked to prevent a division of their own nation at all costs. When Austria was founded from the former western allied and Soviet occupation zones in 1955, Austria made a promise to both sides to neither join the western or the eastern alliance, was however soon locked on the western side of the Iron Curtain.\n\nAustria's commitment to a full neutrality has however been questioned when Austria applied to join the EU in 1989 and eventually did in 1995. Thus, its neutrality is considered less total than the one of its Swiss neighbors."
 belgian_political_system:0 "Political System of Belgium"
 belgian_political_system_desc:0 "Belgium's political system is legendary for being overly complicated. The federal representative democratic constitutional monarchy of Belgium has a king as well as a central and national Belgian parliament (Brussels), a parliament for the Dutch-speaking Flemish community (Brussels), a parliament for the French-speaking Walloon community (Brussels), a parliament for the German-speaking community in the borderlands with Germany (Eupen), as well as a special designation for the officially bilingual capital city Brussels, the 'Capital Region', making Brussels the seat of three parliaments, but putting it ever so slightly out of the jurisdiction of the two regional ones and, of course, under the jurisdiction of its own Brussels parliament.\nAdd to that the subdivision into 10 provinces (not in Brussels though), 43 arrodissements and 589 municipalities and you have a thoroughly complicated and overly inefficient political system - that however succeeds in representing every single citizen sufficiently and thoroughly. Sometimes a bit too thoroughly maybe."

The amendment is a constant cause of conflict within American politics as to its totality - with the government having successfully banned private ownership of weapons like heavy machine guns and land mines in the past, which some activists believe to be infringing upon the Second Amendment.\n\nThe Second Amendment leads to unfortunate situations where a few of the gun owners abuse their weapons to do harm, forcing the government to focus on cleaning up school shootings, hostage situations, gang crime and robberies instead of trying to bring the country forward."
