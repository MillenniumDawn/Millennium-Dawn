 # Military
 NIG_nigerian_armed_forces: "Nigerian Armed Forces"
 NIG_nigerian_armed_forces_desc: "The Nigerian Armed Forces rank as the fifth strongest military in Africa, with roots tracing back to the Nigerian Regiment of the Royal West Africa Frontier Force (RWAFF). Today, the military consists of three primary branches: the Nigerian Army, the Nigerian Navy, and the Nigerian Air Force. With a combined strength of approximately 160,000 personnel, Nigeria's military plays a significant role in regional security operations and international peacekeeping missions across the globe, establishing the nation as a key military power in West Africa."
 NIG_defense_industries_of_nigeria: "Defense Industries of Nigeria"
 NIG_defense_industries_of_nigeria_desc: "The Defense Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON) represents the cornerstone of Nigeria's military-industrial complex. Established to reduce foreign dependency, this network of state-run facilities produces everything from small arms to ammunition and military vehicles. While still developing, these industries are vital to our national security strategy, creating jobs while building indigenous defense capabilities that will strengthen Nigeria's position as a regional power and reduce our reliance on expensive foreign imports."
 NIG_the_army: "The Army"
 NIG_the_army_desc: "The Nigerian Army has participated in many conflicts in its brief history. From civil war and peacekeeping missions across Africa to counter-insurgency operations against various militant groups, our ground forces have gained valuable combat experience. However, equipment shortages and organizational challenges have limited their effectiveness. By modernizing our command structure, improving training programs, and investing in new equipment, we can transform the Nigerian Army into a professional fighting force capable of defending our sovereignty and contributing to regional stability."
 NIG_air_components: "Air Components"
 NIG_air_components_desc: "The Nigerian Air Force has deteriorated significantly, now consisting of only a handful of helicopters and outdated light aircraft. Our aerial capabilities, once a source of national pride, have been neglected for too long. We must urgently revitalize this critical branch of our armed forces through strategic investments in modern aircraft, training programs, and maintenance facilities. Rebuilding our air power is essential not only for national defense but also for supporting counter-insurgency operations and maintaining Nigeria's position as a regional military power."
 NIG_resource_drives: "Resource Drives"
 NIG_resource_drives_desc: "Nigeria faces critical resource shortages as our rapidly growing population strains our supply chains. With over 200 million citizens demanding essential materials, we must secure new resource pipelines through strategic partnerships and domestic development. Without addressing these shortages, our industrial growth will stagnate, threatening both our economic stability and national security. These resource drives will focus on maximizing extraction efficiency while developing sustainable alternatives where possible."
 NIG_abuja_armories: "Abuja Armories"

By investing in modern polymer-based weapon systems, we can provide our troops with significantly lighter firearms that are not only more ergonomic but also cheaper to manufacture at scale. This modernization would enhance our combat effectiveness while reducing logistical burdens, particularly in the challenging terrain where our forces frequently operate."
 NIG_combined_arms: "Nigerian Combined Arms"
 NIG_combined_arms_desc: "Nigeria's diverse terrain presents unique opportunities for multiple combat scenarios - from armored and motorized operations in open fields to aerial support over dense jungles and urban warfare in our growing cities. To maximize our military effectiveness, we must develop a sophisticated combined arms doctrine where all branches of our armed forces communicate seamlessly and operate as a unified fighting force. Without this integration, our military risks fragmentation during critical operations, potentially leading to devastating tactical failures. By investing in joint training exercises and modern command systems, we can transform Nigeria's military into a cohesive fighting force capable of responding to any threat across our varied landscape."
 NIG_helicopter_requests: "Helicopter Requests"
 NIG_helicopter_requests_desc: "The Nigerian Armed Forces urgently require modern helicopter capabilities to address our diverse operational needs.

 NIG_light_submarines: "Anti-Ship Light Submarines"
 NIG_light_submarines_desc: "Light submarines may prove to be beneficial when it comes to anti-piracy operations or local convoy raiding should we ever go to war."
 NIG_corvettes: "Patrol Boats"
 NIG_corvettes_desc: "The Nigerian Navy's strategic focus must be on coastal defense rather than blue-water capabilities. Patrol boats, corvettes, and other light vessels are ideally suited to our maritime security needs, providing cost-effective solutions for anti-piracy operations and territorial protection. These smaller vessels maximize our limited dockyard capacity while offering the maneuverability needed to patrol the Gulf of Guinea and secure our offshore oil infrastructure."
