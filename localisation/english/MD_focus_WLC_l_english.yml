mircea_chelaru_desc: "Born in the village of Rediu in Jassy County, Mircea Chelaru was an average student at Alecsandri High before joining the Military School in Kimpolung. Something must have awakened in him there, as he decided to dedicate himself and his life to a career in the military. After completing his military studies, he quickly rose through the ranks, first becoming a lieutenant in 1977, then an officer in 1978, and eventually a brigadier general by 1997, followed by his promotion to divisional general in 1999.\n\nNaturally, all these honors and distinctions soon attracted the attention of Bucharest, which appointed him Chief of Staff in early 2000. However, Chelaru was soon dismissed following a series of bellicose statements and the exposure of his role in the Targu Mures clashes, which resulted in five deaths and hundreds of injuries. Still, after Vadim was elected President, he insisted on reappointing Chelaru as Chief of Staff due to their ideological similarities. Following the failed March on Bucharest and nationwide riots, Chelaru led a coup to remove Vadim and restore a sense of 'normality'. Initially, the population greeted the news with ecstasy, hoping for a restoration of democracy. However, when it became clear that Chelaru was merely another dictator, riots and violence resumed. Attempts to restore order failed as military units began switching sides, plunging Romania into a civil war.\n\nNow, with the situation stabilized and control over what remains of Romania, Chelaru looks to make his next move."

## WALLACHIA IDEAS ##
WLC_civil_war: "The Romanian Civil War"
WLC_civil_war_desc: "The March on Bucharest and its immediate aftermath have plunged Romania into a disaster, sparking a civil war between liberal and authoritarian factions. Though both sides are momentarily exhausted and the conflict has been paused, it is only a matter of time before it reignites. And when the moment comes, may §Rthe best man win§!."
WLC_new_army: "The New Army"
WLC_new_army_desc: "Following the total collapse of Romania, the land forces underwent extensive reconstruction to adapt to the new realities of our situation."
WLC_supply_depots: "Supply Depots"
WLC_supply_depots_desc: "Due to the presence of large supply depots on the front lines, our units are now able to resupply quickly and efficiently, significantly improving their combat abilities for a while."
## WALLACHIA NATIONAL FOCUSES ##
WLC_calm_spirits: "Calm the Spirits"
WLC_calm_spirits_desc: "Romania has collapsed, but we cannot let this break our spirit. It is crucial that we calm the populace and restore societal order before the situation spirals further out of control."
WLC_martial_law: "Martial Law"
WLC_martial_law_desc: "The first step in restoring our country begins with the introduction of perpetual martial law, transferring full and unrestricted authority to the Army. This will allow us to swiftly address the chaos and ensure absolute control over all aspects of governance and security. To solidify this, we will make certain that the Parliament has no opportunity to oppose or undermine these measures, leaving no room for dissent as we move forward."
WLC_supply_depots: "Establish Supply Depots"
WLC_supply_depots_desc: "If we are to survive this so-called 'revolution,' we must establish supply depots for our army. This will ease our logistical challenges and enable our troops to resupply more efficiently in the field, significantly boosting their operational performance."
WLC_militarize_frontiers: "Militarize the Frontiers"
WLC_militarize_frontiers_desc: "After extensive debates within the Military Circle, it has been decided that fortifying the Carpathian Passes is a crucial step. By strengthening these strategic locations, we can inflict heavy casualties on the Transylvanian rebellion, buying ourselves valuable time to prepare a counteroffensive. As such, we ensure that any gains they make come at a heavy price, all the while weakening their momentum."
WLC_counter_resistance: "Counter the Resistance"
WLC_counter_resistance_desc: "It's clear that we enjoy a significant advantage in both industrial capacity and manpower, allowing us to quickly overwhelm our rivals over the Carpathian passes. As such, it's imperative that we adopt a comprehensive strategy to quickly eliminate them."

WLC_total_mobilization: "Total Mobilization"
WLC_total_mobilization_desc: "Victory requires the total commitment of every individual, of every resource. Only by harnessing that potential will we be able to triumph over those who seek to destroy us."
WLC_weather_storm_desc: "It is no secret that the Transylvanian Government enjoys strong popular support, and they will undoubtedly leverage it to the fullest extent. Thus, we will simply wait out their offensives while simultaneously suppressing dissent on the home front. By preventing further chaos and division from taking hold, we can maintain stability and deny them any advantage gained through internal unrest."
WLC_lightning_fast: "Lightning Fast"
WLC_lightning_fast_desc: "Speed is perhaps our greatest weapon. By streamlining our decision-making and investing in unit mobility we can execute operations and offensives at lightning speeds. The rebels won't even know what him 'em."

This means not only ensuring the swift movement of supplies, personnel, and equipment but also developing systems that can quickly adapt to changing battlefield conditions."
WLC_strategic_reserves: "Strategic Reserves"
WLC_strategic_reserves_desc: "Rather than committing all forces to immediate engagements, holding back a portion of our strength ensures we can respond to enemy breakthroughs, reinforce weakened positions, or launch decisive counteroffensives."
WLC_defensive_cooperation: "Defensive Cooperation"
WLC_defensive_cooperation_desc: "Each unit must be able to quickly respond to the needs of others, whether that means providing reinforcements, offering covering fire, or coordinating counterattacks. By fostering strong communication and cooperation across all levels, we ensure that no position stands isolated and every part of the defense works together to repel enemy attacks."
WLC_mobile_forces: "Mobile Defensive Forces"
WLC_mobile_forces_desc: "Static defenses alone are no longer sufficient to counter dynamic and fast-moving threats. As such, our focus has shifted towards the development of Mobile Defensive Forces- units that are highly flexible, capable of rapid redeployment, and equipped to respond to whatever threats arise."
