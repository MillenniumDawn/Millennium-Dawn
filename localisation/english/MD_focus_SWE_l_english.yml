 SWE_post_crisis_fiscal_decisions: "Post-Crisis Fiscal Decisions"
 SWE_post_crisis_fiscal_decisions_desc: "The Swedish economy, once equipped with the highest incomes in Europe during the 70s, has not managed to stay ahead of the rest. Especially the Crisis of the 90s, when GDP dropped by 5% at the beginning of the decade, scarred the once untouchable Swedish money machine. The 1994 budget had a deficit of 15% the GDP. Now, the government needs to set a convincing policy for the new millennium."
 SWE_riksbank_policy: "Riksbank Policy"
 SWE_riksbank_policy_desc: "The Sveriges Riksbank is Sweden's central bank, active since 1668 and in charge of managing the Swedish Krona, the national currency. The central bank's actions might be central to the fiscal and even diplomatic stance of the government."
 SWE_currency_policy: "Currency Policy"
 SWE_currency_policy_desc: "Inflation and deflation are always central possibilities to consider. As long as Sweden holds the Krona as its exclusive and very own currency, the Riksbank can control the amount of money in circulation and thus the value of the currency on the national and international markets."
 SWE_improve_the_stridsvagn_122: "Improve the Stridsvagn 122"
 SWE_improve_the_stridsvagn_122_desc: "The Stridsvagn 122 is a licensed version of the German Leopard 2A5 main battle tank. Specialized for forest combat, the Stridsvagn still could be the subject of military experiments to perhaps make the next generation of Swedish tanks an even more effective - and maybe this time less German - family of war machines."
 SWE_contracts_for_german_armament_companies: "Contracts for German Armament Companies"
 SWE_contracts_for_german_armament_companies_desc: "The Swedish military sector has never been massive to begin with and its size has also drained over the decades, especially since the end of the Cold War has put 'armed neutrality' a bit further down on government priorities. While we cannot make sure that our weaponry will be perfect ourselves, the Germans certainly would be happy to. Maybe we should consider hiring them."
 SWE_oresund_bridge: "Öresund Bridge"
 SWE_oresund_bridge_desc: "Under construction since the late 1990s, the Öresundsbron (Danish Øresundsbroen) is a massive bridge-and-tunnel project to connect Malmö in southern Sweden with Copenhagen, capital city of Denmark. This would mark a new connection between southern Fennoscandia and the European mainland and make trade easier with the Danes as well as the Germans and other European countries."
 SWE_expand_e20: "Expand E20"
 SWE_expand_e20_desc: "E20, one of the trans-European roads of the E-road network, connects, among others, Denmark and Sweden over the newly constructed Öresund bridge to then run north towards Stockholm, where the road is continued by ferry towards Estonia and Russia. We should make sure traffic over E20 can run freely; for what helps our partners, helps us."
 SWE_expand_malmo_harbor: "Expand Malmö Harbor"
 SWE_expand_malmo_harbor_desc: "With the Öresund completed, we should also focus on making Malmö a new attractive maritime alternative to Göteborg. This would allow our southern trade partners in Denmark, Germany and Poland to more effectively and more quickly ship goods onto the Swedish mainland."
 SWE_expand_the_merchant_fleet: "Expand the Merchant Fleet"
 SWE_expand_the_merchant_fleet_desc: "With wealth, one should make sure to create the basis for more wealth. By constructing an impressive amount of convoys, we should be able to make sure that Sweden literally stays afloat when it comes to economic competitiveness."
 SWE_expand_the_stockholm_docks: "Expand the Stockholm Docks"
 SWE_expand_the_stockholm_docks_desc: "Our most important window into the eastern Baltic and towards Finland, Estonia and Russia is the port system of our capital system, Stockholm. We should expand it to make trade with these countries easier and less of a hassle."
 SWE_northern_friendship: "Northern Friendship"
 SWE_northern_friendship_desc: "Sweden is a nation of peace and there is no reason to change that. We should focus on building lucrative and cordial relations with our European partners, friends and allies."
 SWE_friendship_with_denmark: "Friendship with Denmark"
 SWE_friendship_with_denmark_desc: "Sweden and Denmark required quite a while to discover their love for each other, going to war more than twenty times over the course of the last ten centuries. But Denmark and Sweden, the former the inspiration of the latter's flag, the latter clearly superior to the former in all the other ways, have found each other as friends and partners. And sometimes rivals. Damn danskjävlar."
 SWE_friendship_with_norway: "Friendship with Norway"
 SWE_friendship_with_norway_desc: "Norway was by Sweden's side for a long time - both figuratively and geographically. But while the weird shape of their country is a tale of it's own, it is undeniable that the friendship of our two nations has been of mutual benefit. Even though they chose divorce in 1905. That was rude."
 SWE_friendship_with_the_baltic_states: "Friendship with the Baltic States"
 SWE_friendship_with_the_baltic_states_desc: "Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania share a lot with the Nordic countries - or so they say. While we still attempt to find out which cultural similarities other than a vague linguistic relationship between the Estonian and Finnish languages is supposed to tie Northern Europe to that part of Eastern Europe, we might as well make them our friends already. Why not?"
 SWE_swedish_norwegian_steel_production: "Swedish-Norwegian Steel Production"
 SWE_swedish_norwegian_steel_production_desc: "The borderlands of Sweden and Norway are both rich in natural resources and hard to reach. Maybe, by working together, our two countries can find common ground to stand on. And other, divided, ground that we can mine and sell to the highest bidder."
 SWE_friendship_with_finland: "Friendship with Finland"
 SWE_friendship_with_finland_desc: "Finland has been our loyal neighbor since their independence. And while they wouldn't make the same claims regarding our loyalty after the debacle of the Winter War, our nations are generally on somewhat good terms, especially considering that Finland-Swedes are an important minority that the two nations need to somewhat take care of together."
 SWE_job_opportunities_in_scania: "Job Opportunities in Scania"
 SWE_job_opportunities_in_scania_desc: "With foreign people and businesses alike flocking into southern Sweden, we can afford to sponsor the creation of jobs in this region. More customers means more demand, which means more potential for growth."
 SWE_friendship_with_iceland: "Friendship with Iceland"
 SWE_friendship_with_iceland_desc: "Iceland is a sight to behold and diplomatically the perhaps least controversial country on earth. Not being Iceland's friend is pretty much a sin."
 SWE_expand_e6: "Expand E6"
 SWE_expand_e6_desc: "E6, which leads all the way from northern Norway down to Oslo and from there to the southern tip of Sweden, is one of the most important trade and travel routes between Sweden and its oil-loving, super rich western neighbor. We should cherish the Norwego-Swedish relationship and the trade dynamic of our two nations by keeping the road intact and making it more accessible on our side."
 SWE_further_european_integration: "Further European Integration"
 SWE_further_european_integration_desc: "While Sweden is skeptical of pan-European ideas just from a cultural standpoint, further economic integration has proven undeniably effective. The Germans are buying our stuff and we are buying German stuff. The Danish are buying our stuff and we are buying Danish stuff. Let's sell and buy more stuff."
 SWE_reform_the_diplomatic_agenda: "Reform the Diplomatic Agenda"
 SWE_reform_the_diplomatic_agenda_desc: "The world stage is a very precarious area of affairs and a single misstep can cost thousands of jobs or even millions of lives. We need to make sure Sweden only uses the best of the best when it comes to ambassadors, serving Swedish interests with determination but not so openly as to offend our partners."
 SWE_invite_european_experts: "Invite European Experts"
 SWE_invite_european_experts_desc: "Our European Partners have the personnel needed to solve almost any problem we might face. By inviting them and gathering them in Stockholm, we could gain a new resource of knowledge to draw from."
 SWE_befriend_germany: "Befriend Germany"
 SWE_befriend_germany_desc: "Germany is Sweden's most important destination of exports and the most important origin of imports. To offend the Germans would mean jeopardizing our entire economy."

 SWE_artillery_initiative_desc: "Artillery is very important in the cold north, since soldiers can freeze."
 SWE_infantry_weapons_initiative: "Infantry Weapons Initiative"
 SWE_infantry_weapons_initiative_desc: "Infantry may not be the best option, since it's not fast and we don't have a lot of men to recruit, but we cannot ignore that it forms the backbone of any army."
 SWE_befriend_the_united_kingdom: "Befriend the United Kingdom"
 SWE_befriend_the_united_kingdom_desc: "The UK is a great country, one of the biggest industrial and military powers inside the EU. Let's befriend them and profit."

 SWE_northern_nationalism: "Northern Nationalism"
 SWE_northern_nationalism_desc: "Perhaps, our neighbors are not as puny as one might anticipate when looking at how their flags are generally just inferior versions of ours. Forming a united identity and a united nationalistic fervor, directed against the rest of world, might make our dreams forged by alcohol become a reality forged by blood."
 SWE_justify_swedish_imperialism: "Justify Swedish Imperialism"
 SWE_justify_swedish_imperialism_desc: "Generally, the Swedish colonial endeavors of old are seen as laughable footnotes of history in the modern times. Sweden holding Estonia and Danzig? Colonizing in North America? How silly, right? No longer! These attempts at realizing a Swedish empire under a Swedish sovereign have to be not our subject of ridicule, but our subject of admiration."
 SWE_partnership_of_convenience: "Partnership of Convenience"
 SWE_partnership_of_convenience_desc: "Russia can be our friends very easily, since we both live in cold desolate forests."
 SWE_join_csto: "Join CSTO"
 SWE_join_csto_desc: "In order to find a new position within world politics, we have turned away from our former western partners. Thankfully, there is another isolated authoritarian giant vying for world power close by. Allying the Russians is the next logical step for Swedish greatness."
 SWE_animosity_towards_russia: "Animosity towards Russia"
 SWE_animosity_towards_russia_desc: "We could regain lost popular trust by assuring the Swedish population that we will certainly not draw towards the authoritarians of the east. Russia is not Sweden's friend."

 SWE_rediscover_racial_theories: "Rediscover Racial Theories"
 SWE_rediscover_racial_theories_desc: "Sweden used to be one of the original racists, biological theories about the implications of heritage included. Good times. By welcoming these educative doctrines back into our school, we might just revive a good part of Swedish society."

 SWE_declare_the_finns_honorary_northeners_desc: "Just like one of the fine men of history that we look up to did in November of 1942, we should recognize that the Finnish people are actually part of the master race. These mongoloids can be useful for something after all."

 SWE_the_emperor_of_sweden: "The Emperor of Sweden"
 SWE_the_emperor_of_sweden_desc: "Being a king is good and all, but you know what's better? Being an emperor. 'King of Sweden' sounds like a boring head of state of a boring constitutional monarchy. But 'Emperor of Sweden' sounds like a ruler that is going to make Sweden great again, make Estonia a colony again and make the King of Belgium look like an idiot."

 Sweden.1.t: "The End of the State Church of Sweden"
 Sweden.1.d: "The Church of Sweden is the largest Christian church community in Sweden and the second largest Lutheran community in the world as well as the third-largest protestant church, smaller only than Ethiopia's Lutheran Mekane Yesus and the UK's Anglican Church of England.\n\nThe tight connection between state and the Church of Sweden has been constantly called into question recently, with the Church of Sweden designated the state church of the Swedish government and monarchy. Many other European nations do not give such a position to a particular church body. This, in the eyes of critics, does not only discriminate against foreigners of non-Christian belief, but also the small catholic and orthodox communities of Sweden.\n\nThere is no real power held by the Church of Sweden anymore. Should we not abolish our ties to them? Or stick to them for the sake of tradition?\n\nHistorically, Sweden cut its ties to its state church on January 1st, 2000."
 Sweden.1.o1: "We need to get rid of it!"
 Sweden.1.o2: "Lutheranism is important! Keep it!"
 Sweden.1.o3: "Thor and Odin are far better anyway."
 Sweden.3.t: "The End of the State Church of Sweden"
 Sweden.3.d: "The Church of Sweden is the largest christian church community in Sweden and the second largest Lutheran community in the world as well as the third-largest protestant church, smaller only than Ethiopia's Lutheran Mekane Yesus and the UK's Anglican Church of England.\n\nThe tight connection between state and the Church of Sweden has been constantly called into question recently, with the Church of Sweden designated the state church of the Swedish government and monarchy.

 Sweden.3.o1: "We need to get rid of it!"
 Sweden.3.o2: "Lutheranism is important! Keep it!"
 Sweden.3.o3: "Thor and Odin are far better anyway."
 Sweden.4.t: "Rise of Daniel"
 Sweden.4.d: "Neutral [Root.GetName] has been laughed at for its apparent cowardice since a few centuries. Never would have anyone predicted that the most genius general of not only contemporary military strategy but also all of human history would be raised and trained in Sweden.\n\nDaniel Sjöberg, often simply called \"Da9L\" inside military circles (nobody quite knows why), is possibly the greatest military genius of all time - a man that even outshadows Hannibal, Napoleon Bonaparte and D.D.R. Jake 'the Scot'."
 Sweden.4.o1: "Daniel will lead us to victory!"
 Sweden.5.t: "Post-Crisis Fiscal Decisions"
 Sweden.5.d: "The budgetary and economic crises of the 1990s have left Sweden scarred. Our spending is far exceeding our income and we need to do something."
 Sweden.5.o1: "Welfare cuts are the only choice."
 Sweden.5.o2: "The deficit is inevitable."
 Sweden.6.t: "Riksbank Policy"
 Sweden.6.d: "The central bank of Sweden is primarily tasked with managing the currency, the Swedish Krona, and thus managing inflation and deflation of monetary values in the Swedish economy. The Riksbank needs new orders as to how to proceed over the next few years."
 Sweden.6.o1: "Keep the economy stable."
 Sweden.6.o2: "Inflate the Krona."
 Sweden.7.t: "Pro-Swedish Video Games"
 Sweden.7.d: "Video games are an easy way to influence stupid people who spend more time playing political video games instead of focusing on real issues.\n\nWhat project should we push forwards to completion? (We have already excluded a game set between 1836 and 1936, because that will not happen.)\n\nRemember, we need to teach the kids about how great Sweden is. Also, we need to lock essential gameplay features behind paywalls."
 Sweden.7.o1: "'Ironhearts'. a game about neutrality.."
 Sweden.7.o2: "'Europa Supremalis', a game about enslaving Africans."
 Sweden.7.o3: "'Deus Vult', a game about incest."
 Sweden.8.t: "Sweden demands Equality for Finland-Swedes"
 Sweden.8.d: "Sweden's recent neo-imperialistic aggression against Finland has peaked in demands for equality for the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland.\n\nHere is the thing: They are already equal. The biggest movement within the group claiming otherwise has gathered 50 members so far. There is nothing the Swedes could possibly be offended about - and nothing we can change."
 Sweden.8.o1: "The Swedes are insane."
 Sweden.9.t: "Baltic Colonization Plan"
 Sweden.9.d: "The Baltic States need to return to Swedish dependency status. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were acceptable temporary solutions - but their time is at an end."
 Sweden.9.o1: "For Sweden!"
 Sweden.10.t: "Sweden offers us provincial status"
 Sweden.10.d: "Sure, we always liked the idea of being part of northern Europe, but Sweden has been very... open with us recently. And now, the Swedish royal government has called upon Estonia to join Sweden as a province. This would result in the end of Estonia as a sovereign nation. How preposterous."
 Sweden.10.o1: "We have to fold."
 Sweden.10.o2: "Never!"
 Sweden.11.t: "Estonia resists!"
 Sweden.11.d: "Estonia has dared to reject our generous proposal of taking the burden of guiding the Estonians towards civilization. We were surprised they managed to make their answer letter be free of grammatical errors - but we are also skeptical of what comes next. How should we proceed?"
 Sweden.11.o1: "They misunderstood when they thought there was a choice."
 Sweden.11.o2: "Oh well. We will get them another time."
 Sweden_news.1.t: "Northern Ambition"
 Sweden_news.1.d: "Sweden is taking steps to turn away from its neutral foreign policy doctrines. Whether that will remain in a more active Swedish role in international peacekeeping or a more decisive role in starting local military conflicts still has to be seen however."

The Nobel Prizes are five separate prizes that, according to Alfred Nobel's will of 1895, are awarded to 'those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind'. Alfred Nobel was a Swedish chemist, engineer, and industrialist most famously known for the invention of dynamite. He died in 1896. In his will, he bequeathed all of his "remaining realisable assets" to be used to establish five prizes which became known as "Nobel Prizes." Nobel Prizes were first awarded in 1901."

 Sweden.25.t: "The Rinkeby Murder"
 Sweden.25.d: "The Rinkeby murder took place on 26 February 2002, when 19-year-old Radu Acsinia was shot to death at Rinkeby station on the Stockholm metro, Sweden. On 23 October 2002, the Svea Court of Appeal in Stockholm found four young men jointly guilty of the murder. The two youngest offenders were each sentenced to four years' youth custody, while the remaining two – brothers Önder Yildiz (then aged 20 years) and Özkan Yildiz (24) – were given prison terms of 10 years and life respectively."
 Sweden.25.o1: "Worrying development..."
 
 Sweden.26.t: "The inaugration of Västermalmsgallerian"
 Sweden.26.d: "Västermalmsgallerian is a shopping centre in Kungsholmen, Stockholm, Sweden, inaugurated on 23 August 2002. The shopping centre is located in a renovated building dating from the 1970s in the city block 'Trossen' near the Fridhemsplan metro station at the intersection of the Sankt Eriksgatan and Fleminggatan streets. The name Västermalmsgallerian comes from Västermalm, an alternative name for the district of Kungsholmen. The shopping centre is the first shopping centre in Kungsholmen, including shops for fashion, interior decoration and food. It has a total area of 10'000 m², and includes 45 shops of various sizes and international retail chains."

 Sweden.27.t: "Anna Lindh (S) has been murdered"
 Sweden.27.d: "On 10 September 2003 while shopping in the ladies' section of the Nordiska Kompaniet department store in central Stockholm for a televised debate later that night on the referendum about Sweden's adoption of the euro, Lindh was stabbed in the chest, abdomen and arms. At the time, she was not protected by bodyguards from the Swedish Security Service; this proved controversial, given the similarity between Lindh's murder and that of Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986 (the first murder of a government member in modern Swedish history)."
 Sweden.27.o1: "Oh no"
 Sweden.27.o2: "We will find who did this!"
 
 Sweden.28.t: "The Police found the murderer!"
 Sweden.28.d: "A man was apprehended on 16 September and detained as a suspect on 'justifiable grounds' (the lowest level of suspicion), but was cleared of all charges and released. On 24 September, the police announced that a suspect, Mijailo Mijailović (born in Sweden to Serb parents), had been apprehended and arrested at a higher level of suspicion: 'probable cause'. On 25 September, it was announced that Mijailović's DNA profile matched that of hairs on a baseball cap left at (or near) the scene of the crime, and he resembled the man filmed in the store where Lindh was attacked. After denying all involvement Mijailović confessed to the crime on 6 January 2004, providing a full account of the events of 10 September in an extra session of police questioning requested by Peter Althin (Mijailović's counsel). He was found guilty in a trial held from 14 to 17 January. After a psychiatric evaluation he was sentenced to life imprisonment on 23 March. On 8 July, an appeals court overturned Mijailović's sentence (after tests concluded he was mentally ill at the time of the murder), and Mijailović was transferred to a secure psychiatric ward. Prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court of Sweden, which reinstated his sentence to life imprisonment on 2 December of that year. Mijailović renounced his Swedish citizenship, and has unsuccessfully requested to be transferred to Serbia."

 Sweden_news.1.t: "Nordic Banking Sector Consolidates"
 Sweden_news.1.d: "In a major financial development, Sweden’s Nordbanken has announced a strategic merger with Denmark’s Unibank A/S and Norway’s Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse. The newly unified entity will operate under the name Nordea, becoming one of the largest financial institutions in Northern Europe.\n\nThe move marks a significant step toward economic integration in the Nordic region, streamlining banking services across borders and reinforcing shared financial resilience. Critics warn of centralization, but proponents see opportunity and efficiency in scale."
 Sweden_news.1.o1: "A new financial giant emerges in the North."
 Sweden_news.2.t: "Nordic-Baltic Cooperation Deepens"
 Sweden_news.2.d: "Today, representatives from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania signed a formal declaration strengthening the Nordic-Baltic Eight (NB8) partnership. This regional framework will coordinate policy discussions in areas such as foreign affairs, defense, digital infrastructure, and climate resilience.\n\nWhile not a military alliance, the NB8 is widely seen as a strategic response to increased geopolitical uncertainty in the region. Observers note its potential to develop into a northern bloc with shared diplomatic weight and integrated regional policy mechanisms."
 Sweden_news.2.o1: "Unity through shared interests and geography."
 Sweden_news.3.t: "NORDCAPS Union Established"
 Sweden_news.3.d: "Stockholm has announced the formation of the Nordic Coordinated Approach to Peace and Security or NORDCAPS a new Scandinavian initiative designed to enhance joint defense planning, interoperability, and intelligence sharing among member nations.\n\nWhile not a formal military alliance, NORDCAPS will serve as a platform for structured security cooperation between Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland. Advocates see it as a flexible and Nordic-led complement to existing European defense structures.\n\nExercises, crisis coordination, and shared strategic assessments will form the backbone of the cooperation going forward."
 Sweden_news.3.o1: "Scandinavia stands together."
 Sweden_news.4.t: "The Exercise Is All Around Us"
 Sweden_news.4.d: "Across the quiet towns and rural roads of Sweden, the rumble of engines and the roar of jet turbines have replaced the usual stillness. JAS 39 Gripen fighters take off and land on improvised airstrips—ordinary highways now serve as launch points for air defence. In the dense woods of Småland and Värmland, STRV 122 tanks and CV 90 infantry fighting vehicles move through the underbrush like steel predators. Training munitions echo through the landscape.\n\nFor many civilians, the realization sets in: we are in the middle of a military exercise. Totalförsvaret is not just theory—it is lived experience. The entire country is part of the drill.\n\nSome find reassurance in the preparation. Others feel the weight of what it implies."
 Sweden_news.4.o1: "The nation trains as one."
 Sweden_news.5.t: "Strategic Fortifications Underway"
 Sweden_news.5.d: "Concrete walls rise where forests once stood undisturbed. Engineers reinforce bridges with steel mesh and shaped charges. In the north, bunkers dig into granite; in the south, anti-tank trenches stretch across farmland like scars.\n\nThis is not a return to the past—it is the shape of modern defence. From Östersund to Karlskrona, Sweden braces itself. Every checkpoint, every foxhole, every reinforced tunnel is a message: we will not be caught unprepared.\n\nTotalförsvaret turns terrain into fortress. The country does not sleep it sets its jaw."
 Sweden_news.5.o1: "Let the forests fight with us."
 Sweden_news.6.t: "Forging Leaders for the Front"
 Sweden_news.6.d: "In classrooms and on live-fire ranges, Sweden’s future commanders are being shaped. Tactical theory gives way to smoke drills and sand-table exercises; the pressure of decisions made in minutes hardens instinct into doctrine.\n\nFrom Försvarshögskolan to remote battalion posts, officers hone the skill that separates order from chaos. In Totalförsvaret, leadership is not optional it is the linchpin of survival.\n\nWe do not wait for war to teach us. We prepare in advance."
 Sweden_news.6.o1: "A sharp mind leads steady hands."
 Sweden_news.7.t: "The People in Uniform"
 Sweden_news.7.d: "They arrive in faded camouflage, carrying standard-issue rifles and thermoses from home. They are teachers, mechanics, students—citizens. But this week, they are Hemvärnet.\n\nAcross forests and farmlands, home defence exercises unfold with startling realism. Roadblocks go up overnight. Communications are tested in blackout conditions. Field kitchens feed battalions. Children watch from porches as convoys pass.\n\nThis is not the military coming to the people. It is the people becoming the military."
 Sweden_news.7.o1: "Prepared in peace, ready in crisis."
 Sweden_news.8.t: "The March Home Begins"
 Sweden_news.8.d: "The helmets come off. Checkpoints vanish. Roads once patrolled by armoured vehicles now host bicycles and summer traffic. The mobilized units of Hemvärnet stand down, leaving behind little but ruts in the soil and a memory of movement.\n\nYet something lingers. In every village that hosted a platoon, in every forest cleared for training, there is a subtle shift. We returned to normal—but normal now knows what preparation feels like.\n\nTotalförsvaret taught us that security is not the absence of fear. It is the presence of readiness."
 Sweden_news.8.o1: "Normal, but never naive again."
 Sweden_news.9.t: "A Nation Called to Readiness"
 Sweden_news.9.d: "The activation order came just after dawn. Within hours, uniforms were unpacked, weapons collected, radios crackled to life. In towns and outposts across Sweden, the quiet machinery of mobilisation began to hum.\n\nHemvärnet doesn’t arrive with ceremony—it simply appears. Road intersections are secured. Communications hubs are manned. The forests whisper again with movement.\n\nThere is no panic. Only determination. The country has trained for this moment. Now, it enacts it."
 Sweden_news.9.o1: "Ordinary people. Extraordinary readiness."


### Ideas ###
 SWE_idea_swedish_legacy: "The Swedish Legacy"
 SWE_idea_swedish_legacy_desc: "Few nations of our size have maintained such a long-standing independence through centuries of geopolitical pressure. Sweden’s legacy is one of neutrality, innovation, and military competence without aggression. From Gustavian reforms to the Cold War doctrine of armed neutrality, the Swedish model is built on deterrence through readiness and a deeply embedded societal will to defend.\n\nIn this legacy, we find both identity and obligation."
 SWE_idea_fast_reaction_force: "Fast Reaction Force"
 SWE_idea_fast_reaction_force_desc: "In the post–Cold War era, speed is as valuable as strength. Sweden’s Försvarsmakten has developed dedicated snabbinsatsstyrkor—units equipped and trained to deploy rapidly within or beyond national borders. These formations rely on mobility, interoperability, and real-time command structures.\n\nThey don’t wait for threats to knock—they move to meet them halfway."
 SWE_the_balanced_Army: "The Balanced Army"
 SWE_the_balanced_Army_desc: "Rather than specializing in one domain, Sweden’s military doctrine emphasizes balance: between mobility and firepower, standing forces and reserves, conventional strength and civil resilience. The result is a force that may not dominate globally, but one that cannot be easily broken.\n\nIn Sweden, victory is measured in endurance—not conquest."
 SWE_heavy_defense_focus: "Heavy Defence Focus"
 SWE_heavy_defense_focus_desc: "We prepare not to invade, but to hold. Swedish doctrine places strategic emphasis on defence in depth—using terrain, fortifications, and layered units to bleed an aggressor dry. From coastal mines to hardened command shelters buried in bedrock, our strength lies not in blitz, but in refusal to collapse.\n\nThis is a military built to make occupation unthinkable."
 SWE_idea_Armestaben: "Arméstaben – Central Army Command"
 SWE_idea_Armestaben_desc: "Reestablished as a command nerve for land operations, Arméstaben plays a vital role in coordination and strategic readiness. Its structure merges doctrine development with field logistics, ensuring Swedish forces remain both modern and responsive.\n\nThe return of a centralized army staff signals our intent: we plan, we adapt, and we lead ourselves."
 SWE_idea_total_defence_duty: "Duty to the Total Defence"
 SWE_idea_total_defence_duty_desc: "Totalförsvaret is not simply a policy—it is an obligation. Swedish citizens are expected to serve not only in uniform, but through civil preparedness: logistics, medical care, infrastructure, and crisis response. In times of threat, the entire nation becomes a system of resistance.\n\nTotal defence is not about conscription alone. It is about contribution, from every Swede."
 SWE_idea_active_training: "Active Duty Training Routines"
 SWE_idea_active_training_desc: "Forces that train only in theory fall first in practice. Sweden maintains a robust schedule of combined arms training, joint branch exercises, and real-condition scenarios. From frozen archipelagos to urban terrain, our troops rehearse not just tactics—but adaptation.\n\nCombat readiness is not declared. It is trained into habit."
 SWE_idea_total_training: "Comprehensive Defence Training"
 SWE_idea_total_training_desc: "Training in Sweden extends beyond the standing military. Police, civil defense, healthcare, infrastructure, and local governments all take part in contingency exercises. The outcome is not merely logistical—it is cultural. Society expects to function under pressure.\n\nWe don’t simulate collapse. We simulate how to outlast it."
 SWE_idea_nb8: "Nordic-Baltic Eight (NB8)"
 SWE_idea_nb8_desc: "The NB8 is a platform of pragmatic cooperation between the Nordic and Baltic states—unified by geography, economic interest, and shared security concerns. Through diplomatic coordination and joint initiatives, the NB8 gives Sweden a flexible, civilian-led regional voice outside of major power blocs.\n\nQuiet alliances build strong borders."
 SWE_idea_nordefco: "NORDEFCO – Nordic Defence Cooperation"
 SWE_idea_nordefco_desc: "NORDEFCO blends the defence capacities of the Nordic states without requiring full alliance integration. Joint procurement, shared exercises, and interoperable command structures strengthen the region’s security mosaic. For Sweden, it is a way to strengthen deterrence without sacrificing sovereignty.\n\nUnity in flexibility. Defence without surrender."
 SWE_idea_swedish_banking: "Swedish Banking System"
 SWE_idea_swedish_banking_desc: "Built on trust, regulation, and technological foresight, Sweden’s banking system is among the most resilient in Europe. With high digital penetration, low cash reliance, and conservative credit policy, it can weather economic turbulence with quiet confidence.\n\nIn a volatile world, fiscal restraint is strength."
 SWE_idea_focus_energy_preferred_renewable: "Renewable Energy Priority"
 SWE_idea_focus_energy_preferred_renewable_desc: "Sweden has long led the shift toward renewable energy, driven by hydropower, wind expansion, and biofuel initiatives. Energy independence here is not just ecological—it is geopolitical. Reducing foreign dependency strengthens national resilience, especially in times of crisis.\n\nGreen energy is not just idealism. It is insulation from external pressure."
 SWE_idea_expanding_digital_infrastructure: "Digital Backbone Expansion"
 SWE_idea_expanding_digital_infrastructure_desc: "Sweden’s commitment to digital infrastructure runs deeper than fiber optic cables. It is a strategic posture—cybersecurity, data sovereignty, and digital public services form the pillars of modern resilience. From e-governance to encrypted communications, the nation’s networks are built for redundancy and control.\n\nOur strength runs on code and copper alike."
 SWE_development_found_of_the_swedish_construction_industry: "The Foundation of Modern Swedish Construction"
 SWE_development_found_of_the_swedish_construction_industry_desc: "Postwar Sweden invested heavily in infrastructure, culminating in a robust and versatile construction sector. From bridges in Norrland to underground rail in Stockholm, Swedish firms build for durability, efficiency, and harsh climates. In times of crisis, this capacity becomes dual-use—repair, reinforce, rebuild.\n\nOur engineers don’t just construct—they defend the future in concrete."


### Decision defense ###
 SWE_decision_Forsvarsmarkten_category: "Försvarsmakten"
 SWE_decision_Forsvarsmarkten_category_desc: "\n£GFX_swedisch_homeguard\n\n\n\n\nThe Swedish defence system is built upon the concept of Totalförsvaret – a unified approach combining both military and civil preparedness. Under this doctrine, Försvarsmakten works alongside civilian agencies like MSB to ensure national resilience in times of crisis or war. The reactivated värnplikt provides a steady flow of trained personnel, reinforcing the armed forces and creating a society capable of collective resistance. Every citizen is part of the nation's defence plan, from mobilization to sustained resistance operations."
 SWE_Home_Guard: "Expand Hemvärnet"
 SWE_Home_Guard_desc: "The Hemvärnet serves as the backbone of local defence and rapid response. By expanding its size, regional readiness will improve, and our ability to resist incursions or sudden attacks will be greatly enhanced. The local connection of these units ensures resilience even under pressure."
 SWE_fortifications: "Fortify Strategic Locations"
 SWE_fortifications_desc: "To safeguard key areas, we must invest in robust defensive positions. From the coastlines of Skåne to the forests of Norrland, fixed fortifications can delay or repel any aggressor long enough for mobilization to complete."
 SWE_Officer_education_course: "Officer Education Program"
 SWE_Officer_education_course_desc: "Leadership in Försvarsmakten must be cultivated through rigorous and continuous education. By expanding our officers' training programs at institutions such as Försvarshögskolan, we ensure strategic competence and battlefield excellence."
 SWE_only_active_Personal_Trainings_exercise: "Conduct Active Personnel Exercises"
 SWE_only_active_Personal_Trainings_exercise_desc: "Routine drills and field exercises are essential to keep our standing forces alert and combat-ready. These exercises will reinforce discipline, coordination, and readiness under realistic conditions."
 SWE_Home_defence_Trainings_exercise: "Train Home Defence Units"
 SWE_Home_defence_Trainings_exercise_desc: "Preparedness starts at home. By conducting large-scale exercises for reservists and volunteer units, we strengthen our capability to respond to hybrid threats and unconventional warfare scenarios."
 SWE_launch_total_defence: "Activate Totalförsvaret"
 SWE_launch_total_defence_desc: "Totalförsvaret mobilizes the entire nation. Civilian infrastructure, emergency services, and military forces will operate in unison under a coordinated national defence strategy. This measure marks a shift from peacetime routines to full-spectrum preparedness."
 SWE_back_to_normality: "Demobilize and Return to Normality"
 SWE_back_to_normality_desc: "With the threat receding, we may begin to scale back our heightened state of readiness. Totalförsvaret will stand down, and the nation will transition back to peacetime routines, but the lessons and structures will remain in place for the future."

### Dynamic modifiers

# Title + desc

 SWE_heavy_industry_modifier: "Legacy of Swedish Heavy Industry"
 SWE_heavy_industry_modifier_desc: "Forged in the foundries of the 20th century, Sweden’s heavy industry remains a cornerstone of national power. From armored vehicles to hydroelectric turbines, our production capacity is reliable, adaptable, and deeply integrated with export markets. Companies like Bofors, Scania, and Volvo AB form the industrial spine of Totalförsvaret, capable of shifting from civilian to military output when the moment demands it.\n\nSteel still flows in Swedish veins."
 SWE_Vattenfall_modifier: "Vattenfall – Powering the North"
 SWE_Vattenfall_modifier_desc: "Founded over a century ago and still state-owned, Vattenfall is more than an energy provider—it is a strategic asset. Through hydroelectric dominance and growing control over nuclear and district heating systems, Vattenfall ensures Sweden’s energy resilience in both peace and conflict. Its grid integration across the Nordic region also makes it a key player in regional energy diplomacy.\n\nWhen others import power, Sweden generates its own."
 SWE_tech_and_science_modifier: "Swedish Innovation and Research"
 SWE_tech_and_science_modifier_desc: "From telecommunications breakthroughs at Ericsson to biomedical advances at Karolinska, Sweden’s research ecosystem is one of the most advanced in Europe. Close ties between state, academia, and industry create a feedback loop of innovation, enabling military-grade R&D, digital infrastructure growth, and world-class engineering.\n\nIn Sweden, innovation is not a sector—it is a strategy."
 SWE_financial_place_modifier: "Nordic Financial Hub"
 SWE_financial_place_modifier_desc: "With Stockholm as its beating heart, Sweden has evolved into a financial hub for the Nordic-Baltic region. Institutions like Nordea, SEB, and the Riksbank anchor stable capital flows and modern regulatory systems, while digital banking leads the charge into a cashless economy. Financial resilience is more than numbers—it is national security.\n\nSweden’s markets may be small by global standards, but they punch above their weight."
