 Kurdistan.1.t:0 "Independence Referendum of Kurdistan"
 Kurdistan.1.d:0 "Kurdistan has enjoyed a degree of autonomy in Iraq ever since the deposing of Saddam Hussein. However, since the invasion of Iraq, the country has been mainly dominated by various Shia groups, which has led many of the Kurds (who are mainly Sunni) feeling left out.\n\nThe rise of ISIS has allowed Kurdistan to increase its influence. After the collapse of the Iraqi Army in 2014 left Northern Iraq under ISIS control, the Kurds quickly stepped in claim territory from ISIS, including Kirkuk, the cultural capital of Iraq.\n\nDue to the waning power of ISIS, we finally have the opportunity to hold an independence referendum for Kurdistan"
 Kurdistan.1.a:0 "Hold the referendum" 
 Kurdistan.1.b:0 "We should reunite with Iraq" 
 Kurdistan.2.t:0 "Kurdistan Wishes to Unite With Iraq"
 Kurdistan.2.d:0 "Since the threat of ISIS is now gone, the Kurdistan Regional Government has expressed willingness to federal government of Iraq"
 Kurdistan.2.a:0 "Welcome back home!"
 
 KurdistanNews.1.t:0 "Kurdistan Rejoins Iraq"
 KurdistanNews.1.d:0 "During the apex of ISIS, Kurdistan started slowly shifting away from Iraq and becoming more independent. Now that ISIS has been defeated, the Kurdistan Regional Government seems to have made a full turn and expressed wishes to start working again together with the Iraqi federal government. Many speculated that the Kurds would be aiming for independence, but it seems they've decided to decide otherwise, possibly fearing repercussions from their neighbours."
 KurdistanNews.1.a:0 "Interesting"
 KurdistanNews.2.t:0 "The Kurdish Independence Referendum"
 KurdistanNews.2.d:0 "The Kurdish Regional Government has announced that it will be holding an independence referendum in the areas that they currently control. The move has been called controversial, due to the referendum being held in areas that aren't officially part of the Kurdish Autonomous Region but the Federal State of Iraq, including the major city of Kirkuk.\n\nMany see this as nothing more than a landgrab by the Kurds, while others argue that the Kurds have earned their right to independence after practically saving Iraq from ISIS. Even though the KRG claims that the results will be non-binding, many fear that it will lead to a full independence, and possibly a new conflict in Iraq."
 KurdistanNews.2.a:0 "They have no right to do this!"
 KurdistanNews.2.b:0 "Let's see how this play out"
