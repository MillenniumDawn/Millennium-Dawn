 #Decisions
 war_on_terror_category:0 "OEF and the War on Terror"
 war_on_terror_category_desc:0 "Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) is the official name used by the U.S. government for the Global War on Terrorism. This strategy targets terrorist organisations in foreign countries, and allows the US to strike terrorists and theirs supporters with impunity"
 usa_increase_intelligence_spending:0 "Increase Intelligence Spending"
 usa_increase_intelligence_spending_desc:0 "We have scattered reports of an oncoming serious terrorist attack. We currently don't have the tools to combat this threat properly. We need to expand intelligence funding, and increase the surveillance rights of the FBI and CIA. This will be costly politically, but the safety of our nation is in jeopardy."
 usa_demand_extradition_of_bin_laden:0 "Demand Extradition of Osama bin Laden"
 usa_demand_extradition_of_bin_laden_desc:0 "According to our intel, Osama bin Laden was the main force behind the recent terrorist attack. As far as we know, he is currently residing in Afghanistan, under the protection of the Taliban. We should contact the Taliban, and demand that they cut their ties with the Al-Qaeda and deliver bin Laden to us."
 usa_operation_enduring_freedom:0 "Execute Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)"
 usa_operation_enduring_freedom_desc:0 "The Taliban have refused to give us bin Laden, so we'll have to get him ourselves. We need to prepare Operation Enduring Freedom, which will allow us to send equipment and put boots on the ground in Afghanistan."
 usa_homeland_security_act:0 "Establish Homeland Security"
 usa_homeland_security_act_desc:0 "The administration has brought forward the idea of a new ministry, the 'United States Department of Homeland Security'. The Homeland Security is to absorb 22 federal bureaus and offices, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nSeated in the Nebraska Avenue Complex, the Homeland Security will be tasked with protecting the United States of America and her allies from foreign subversive threats, primarily from terrorism. Other countries mostly bestow this task upon the ministry of the interior, but the American one has obviously failed to do so."

 wot.2.t:0 "Major Terrorist Attack on the East Coast"
 wot.2.da:0 "We have received reports of an attempted terrorist attack on the East Coast. Early morning today, several suspected Al-Qaeda members were arrested at the Logan International Airport in Boston and the Dulles International Airport in Waschington D.C.. Despite these early warnings, five terrorists manage to board Flight 93 at the Newark International Airport in New York. As they tried to hijack the flight, resistance from passengers eventually led to them crashing the plane into a field in Stonycreek Township in Pennsylvania. The crew of seven and 33 passengers and the five hijackers were all killed in the crash.\n\nBased on our current intelligence, the planes were intended to be crashed to several targets on the East Coast, including the World Trade Center, Pentagon and the Capitol building.\n\nFortunately our intelligence services were on the lookout, and we managed to prevent a terrible tragedy."
 wot.2.db:0 "We have received reports of a major terrorist attack on the East Coast. The hijackers, most likely members of Al-Qaeda, used the commercial airliners American Airlines Flight 11, United Airlines Flight 175, American Airlines Flight 77 and United Airlines Flight 93 as flying bombs against the United States. \n\nEarly morning today, at 8:46 AM, Flight 11 hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, shortly followed by Flight 175 hitting the South Tower at 9:03 AM. At 9:37 AM, Flight 77 hit the Pentagon in Washington D.C.. The fourth plane, Flight 93, which was presumably headed towards the Capitol, crashed at 10:03 AM as the passengers tried to retake it from the hijackers.\n\nOur nation has to recover from a horrifying day. The political situation is completely different from what it was yesterday."

The terrorists managed to keep the plane in the air and eventually crashed it into the side of the Capitol building at 10:23.\n\nOur nation has to recover from a horrifying day.

 wot.3.t:0 "Diplomatic Response to the World Trade Center Attacks"
 wot.3.d:0 "The United States of America was deliberately and suddenly attacked by enemy terrorist combatants.\n\nAs the United States is preparing for its diplomatic and military response to the attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the [Root.GetAdjective] foreign minister is increasingly pushing for the government to release a firm and decisive statement on the matter."
 wot.3.a:0 "We stand with America! No matter what!"
 wot.3.b:0 "Condemn the attacks, but don't make promises."
 wot.3.c:0 "This is what happens when you interfere with other countries."
 wot.4.t:0 "Local politician backs the government"
 wot.4.da:0 "As the Republican administration is scrambling to find a decisive response to the recent terrorist attack, the Democratic Party has so far stood by and more or less observed the situation, making statements of condemnation against the attackers but no certain political promises or demands.\n\nNow, a major member of the Democratic Party from the affected state, New York, has taken up a central position in the reactions to the attacks: Hillary Clinton, Senator from New York and former First Lady of the United States, has held a clear speech: "Every nation has to either be with us, or against us. Those who harbor terrorists, or who finance them, are going to pay a price.".\n\nThe Democrats up and down the country have begun rallying around Clinton's statements, signalling not only solidarity with their senator but also with the Republican administration to proceed and to take up any means necessary to find a proper answer to this not only atrocious, but fundamentally anti-American attack."

 wot.5.d:0 "A National Pareyer Service has been suggested to be held at the Washington National Cathedral for the victims of the terrorist attacks.

 wot.5.a:0 "This is an important service"
 wot.5.b:0 "We don't need this to remember the victims"
 wot.6.t:0 "Murder of Balbir Singh Sodhi"
 wot.6.d:0 "As a direct result of the terrorist attacks, islamophobic sentiment and violence across the United States increased dramatically - but most of the attacks stayed at racially or religiously charged verbal abuse, theft or damage of property. Not so with Balbir Singh Sodhi.\n\nThe Indian-born Sikh was mistakenly identified as Muslim (because of his middle eastern complexion and his turban) by 42-year-old Frank Silva Roque at Singh's gas station in Mesa, Arizona. Singh was subsequently shot dead by Roque from his truck with a .380 handgun. Roque fled the scene and, twenty minutes later, tried to kill another person, a Lebanon-born store clerk .\nAfter failing at this assassination attempt, Roque ended his terror spree at his own former residence, now taken up by an Afghan family, firing shots at the building but causing no casualties. He would be arrested the following day and eventually sentenced to death for first degree murder."
 wot.6.a:0 "We will never surrender to terrorists! No matter the skin color!" 
 wot.6.b:0 "It was an understandable misunderstanding"
 wot.7.t:0 "Anthrax Attacks"
 wot.7.d:0 "The anthrax attacks, also known as Amerithrax from its FBI case name, began shortly after the terrorist attack.\n\nLetters containing anthrax spores were sent to multiple individuals, including news reporters and two U.S. senators. The incident of bio-terrorism is thought to be connected to the terrorist attack on the East Coast (but the ongoing FBI investigation has not found conclusive evidence yet) and has so far killed 5 people and injured 17 more."
 wot.7.a:0 "All obstacles we will overcome" 
 wot.7.b:0 "We must find the ones who did this!" 
 wot.8.t:0 "The War on Terror Speech"
 wot.8.d:0 "[USA.GetLeader] held a speech to a joint session of the U.S. Congress, declaring a, as he calls it, "War on Terror".\n\nThe President promised resolute and straight reactions to terror and famously made the following address to all other countries of the world: "Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.""
 wot.8.a:0 "Justice we shall bring" 
 wot.8.b:0 "And it shall be swift" 
 wot.9.t:0 "US Demands Extradition of Osama bin Laden"
 wot.9.d:0 "After the terror attack on the East Coast, the US has contacted our officials and they are demanding that we sever all links to our allies the Al-Qaeda and their leader Osama bin Laden. We also have to capture bin Laden and deliver him to the hands of the US. Based on the previous rhetoric, declining the request will surely turn the US into our enemy."
 wot.9.a:0 "The Great Satan will have nothing!"
 wot.9.b:0 "Maybe a deal with the devil is necessary..."
 wot.10.t:0 "Taliban Refuse Extradition"
 wot.10.d:0 "The Taliban have refused to stop cooperating with Al-Qaeda and bin Laden. It seems that the only way for us to get criminals to court is to topple the entire Taliban regime."
 wot.10.a:0 "This wasn't a surprising outcome"
 wot.11.t:0 "Taliban Agree on Extradition"
 wot.11.d:0 "Surprisingly, the Taliban have agreed to kick out Al-Qaeda from the country, and hunt down bin Laden. They said that they are willing to cooperate with the US military to bring terrorists to justice.\n\nTHERE'S NO FOLLOW UP CONTENT FOR THIS! NEEDS TO BE DONE"
 wot.11.a:0 "This is...odd"
 wot.12.t:0 "US Requests Help With Taliban"
 wot.12.d:0 "The United States is going to drive out the Taliban out of Afghanistan. They have requested our support in the fight."
