 badakhshan_resistance_dynamic_modifier_desc: "Throughout the Tajik Civil War (1992-1997), Gorno-Badakhshan became a bastion for opposition forces advocating for greater autonomy or outright independence from Tajikistan. Even after the war, many in Badakhshan continued to challenge the central government, demanding more political freedom and economic rights. The local population's grievances stem from a sense of political exclusion and neglect by the government, which is perceived as prioritizing the interests of the Tajik majority while undermining the region's autonomy."

 TAJ_emomali_rahom_desc: "Emomali Rahmonov is the long-serving President of Tajikistan, having been in power since 1992. He rose to prominence after the fall of the Soviet Union and the outbreak of the Tajik Civil War (1992-1997), during which he consolidated his rule by defeating various opposition factions, including Islamist and pro-democracy forces. Rahmonov has maintained a highly centralized and authoritarian government, often using repression to suppress political dissent and media freedom. Under Rahmonov, Tajikistan has remained a close ally of Russia and has struggled with economic challenges, relying heavily on remittances from Tajik migrant workers abroad, especially in Russia. His administration has also been marked by efforts to promote national unity through the promotion of Tajik identity and language, distancing from Russian cultural influences, while also combating radical Islamic movements within the country."
