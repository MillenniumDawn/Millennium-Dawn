 # Moroccan Events
 morocco.1.t: "The Bounty of the Mountains"
 morocco.1.d: "For centuries, the Atlas and Rif mountains have been more than just our home - they have been the source of our stories, our livelihood, and our resources. As we enter this new century, global resources grow increasingly scarce, yet our recent prospecting has revealed promising discoveries. These majestic mountains, which define our nation's landscape, harbor untold riches beneath their peaks. Now we must decide: should we pursue an aggressive exploitation of these reserves, or take a more measured, cautious approach to preserve our natural heritage?"
 morocco.1.a: "Cautious Growth"
 morocco.1.b: "Exploit Every Reserve!"
 morocco.1.c: "Exploit the Reserves, but maintain sustainability."

 morocco.400.t: "The Casablanca Bombings"
 morocco.400.d: "Today, Casablanca was struck by a series of coordinated terrorist attacks. Twelve suicide bombers detonated explosives at multiple locations including the Casa de España, Hotel Farah, the Jewish Alliance of Casablanca, and sites near the Belgian consulate and the historic Jewish cemetery. The attacks claimed forty-five lives, including the bombers themselves, and left over a hundred civilians injured. Intelligence suggests these attacks stem from the growing influence of Salafist preachers, many being veterans of the Soviet-Afghan War, who have increasingly radicalized followers. While GCIM and al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attacks, targeting the Jewish community despite no Jewish casualties, local analysts point to the proliferation of impoverished 'Shanty Towns' as breeding grounds for extremism within Morocco."
 morocco.400.a: "A dark day for Morocco..."
 morocco.400.b: "We shall honor the victims and their families."

 morocco_bop.1.t: "The Title of the King"
 morocco_bop.1.d: "Throughout Morocco's rich history, our monarchs have carried titles of profound significance - from the ancient Sultans of the Almoravid dynasty to the Kings of modern times. Each title reflects not just authority, but the very character of our nation's leadership. While we have worn the title of King since independence, reflecting our position between East and West, some now advocate for a return to more traditional Islamic titles that resonate with our cultural heritage.\n\nThe choice before us is more than mere symbolism. Whether we maintain the title of King, embrace the historical mantle of Sultan, or adopt another prestigious designation, our decision will signal Morocco's direction in the modern world. This title must embody both our cherished traditions and our aspirations for the future, serving as a unifying symbol that all Moroccans can honor with pride."
 morocco_bop.1.a: "Remain a King"
 morocco_bop.1.b: "The Title of Sultan"
 morocco_bop.1.c: "The Title of Shah"
 morocco_bop.1.e: "The Title of Caliph"

 morocco_bop.2.t: "The Role of the Crown"
 morocco_bop.2.d: "As Morocco enters the 21st century, the role of the Crown stands at a historic crossroads. For generations, the Moroccan monarchy has wielded substantial influence over governmental affairs, religious matters, and civic life. While this traditional authority has provided stability, voices across the political spectrum now debate the monarchy's proper place in our modern democracy. Some advocate for maintaining the Crown's historic prerogatives, while others call for a more limited constitutional role.\n\nThe time has come to chart our course forward. Will the Crown continue its active leadership in shaping Morocco's future, adapt to a more balanced partnership with Parliament, or embrace a primarily ceremonial role? This pivotal decision will define not only the monarchy's future but the very nature of Moroccan governance for generations to come."

 morocco_bop.3.t: "Parliamentary Involvement"
 morocco_bop.3.d: "The parliament has rountinely had the crown's influence since the inception of the current Morocacn state. However, some now call for a more limited constitutional role. The question before us is whether the Crown should continue its active leadership in shaping Morocco's future, adapt to a more balanced partnership with Parliament, or embrace a primarily ceremonial role? The crown must decide what its powers should be with respect to the parliament and their process."

 morocco_bop.3.b: "The Crown Should Adapt to a More Balanced Partnership"
 morocco_bop.3.c: "The Crown Should Embrace a Ceremonial Role"

 morocco_bop.4.t: "The Status of the Amazigh Languages"
 morocco_bop.4.d: "The Amazigh (Berber) langauges are some of the oldest and most widely spoken langauges in the mountains of Morocco and closer to the Sahara Desert. Although the Amaziggh languages are not one unified language, it is important that we preserve our cultural heritage and history... or at least the parts that are useful to the crown.\n\nDo we want to provide the Amazigh languages with official status or leave them as a unofficial minority language?"
 morocco_bop.4.a: "The Amazigh Languages are Official"
 morocco_bop.4.b: "The Amazigh Languages are Not Official"
 morocco_bop.4.c: "The Amazigh Languages are a Minority Language"

 morocco_bop.5.t: "The Status of the Hassaniya Language"
 morocco_bop.5.d: "Similar to the Amazigh languages, the Hassaniya language is a language of the south Moroccan Berbers. It predomaintnly spoken in the southern provinces of the country and represents a dialect of Bedouin Arabic which is heavily influenced by Subsaharan African languages and the local tribal languages.\n\nDo we want to provide the Hassaniya language with official status or leave it as a unofficial minority language?"
 morocco_bop.5.a: "The Hassaniya Language is Official"
 morocco_bop.5.b: "The Hassaniya Language is Not Official"
 morocco_bop.5.c: "The Hassaniya Language is a Minority Language"

 morocco_bop.6.t: "The Power of Amnesty"
 morocco_bop.6.d: "The Moroccan constitution grants the crown the power to grant amnesty to any person within the Moroccan state. The crown has used this power to their own advantage in the past, but some now call for a limitation of this power. The question before us is whether the Crown should retain the power of amnesty, or allow the Parliament to grant amnesty to anyone they deem worthy."

 morocco_bop.6.b: "Allow the Parliament to Grant Amnesty"
