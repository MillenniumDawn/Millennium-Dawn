Range can be affected by motorization which uses £GFX_unit_motorized_icon_small §YTrucks§!.\n\nEfficiency is further affected by the level of the £GFX_railways_texticon §YRailways§! and £GFX_naval_supply_hub_texticon §YNaval Bases§!, lack of £GFX_train_texticon §YTrains§!, and enemy air strikes. This creates §Rbottlenecks§!. These can be mitigate by upgrading the railways to the capital supply hub, provide air defences with figters and make sure to have enough trains.
