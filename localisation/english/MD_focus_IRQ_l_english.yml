 # Events
 iraqi_events.1.t: "New Year Reports"
 iraqi_events.1.d: "As the year 2000 dawns upon Iraq, the nation finds itself grappling with a host of formidable challenges that threaten its stability and progress. Iraq continues to grapple with the suffocating impact of international sanctions imposed following the Gulf War. These sanctions have severely hampered the country's ability to rebuild its infrastructure, revive its economy, and provide essential services to its citizens. The restrictions on trade and financial transactions have resulted in a stagnant economy, high unemployment rates, and widespread poverty. The scarcity of resources and limited access to vital technologies further exacerbate Iraq's struggles. Furthermore, Iraq's political isolation persists as suspicions linger among the international community regarding the government's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and its alleged human rights abuses. This isolation hampers Iraq's ability to establish fruitful diplomatic relations, engage in mutually beneficial partnerships, and regain its rightful place in the global stage. Internally, Iraq faces deep-seated social discontent arising from the mismanagement of resources, systemic corruption, and inadequate public services. These issues have led to public frustration, deteriorating trust in the government, and a growing sense of disillusionment among the population. Addressing these grievances is crucial for fostering social cohesion and ensuring the well-being of the Iraqi people."
 iraqi_events.1.o1: "Interesting."

 iraqi_events.2.t: "Iraq asks for our aid"
 iraqi_events.2.d: "With the aftermath of the war in Iraq and the start of a new Democratic government appointed by the West in it, it seems the odds are not too much in favor of this new-found government. Hence, they are asking for aid from their allies, which are us. So, how should we respond to their proposal for aid?"
 iraqi_events.2.o1: "We help them!"
 iraqi_events.2.o2: "We're too busy for Iraq."

 iraqi_events.3.t: "Iraq asks for energy investments"
 iraqi_events.3.d: "With the end of the American madness in Iraq with their invasion, it seems now that the new Iraqi government is looking for a cooperative stance in the region, which includes us specifically. Since great damage has been done to the Iraqi infrastructure and energy, it seems that they are asking any country that has power in the region to help them settle things down in their own country. It seems they want us to do our part too, in electricity and gas imports. Surely this is a tempting offer for us since our influence in Iraq would become greater. How should we respond to their offer?"
 iraqi_events.3.o1: "Sure!"
 iraqi_events.3.o2: "We're too busy for Iraq."

 iraqi_events.4.t: "Iran Accepts"
 iraqi_events.4.d: "Soon, Iranian engineers will arrive for constructing new electricity power houses in our country! Surely, we will not forget this really good investment of the Iranians."
 iraqi_events.4.o1: "Thank you!"

 iraqi_events.5.t: "Iran Rejects"
 iraqi_events.5.d: "It seems, they weren't that much interested at us."
 iraqi_events.5.o1: "Sad."
