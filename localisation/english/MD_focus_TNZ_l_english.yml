 TNZ_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "After independence was won in 1961, the free Tanganyikan Republic and Zanzibar joined in a union to create the modern state of Tanzania. Under the one party leadership of the first President, Julius Nyerere, the country underwent radical socialist policies. In hindsight it held back economic growth, but succeeded well in bringing about a sense of national unity under a common language: Kiswahili.\n\nUnder the same party Tanzania is now moving in another direction. Privatisation of the economy and a multiparty system gives Tanzania a glim of hope for the next generation."
 TNZ_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "One of Africa's giants, Tanzania still lags behind emerging economies on the continent like South Africa and Nigeria... Until the last decade. Tanzania has promoted political and economic freedom to rapidly industrialize the economy. Now Tanzania enjoys as one of the world's fastest growing economy and all indicators show that it will be so for a while longer. However critics point out the ruling party's inability to crack down on corruption and the frequent harrasments against the opposition parties, leading some to simply put it that the democracy in Tanzania is under attack.  \n \n Tanzania still has a long way to go, so shall Tanzania prosper or will her leaders lead her to despair?"

 TNZ.0.t: "The United Republic of Tanzania"
 TNZ.0.d: "Tanzania is an East African Republic with just over 34 million inhabitants by the turn of the Millennia. Many iconic African landmarks spot the countryside that is also  filled with boundless diversity of fauna. It will soon be the 40 year anniversarywhen Julius Nyerere became President of Tanzania and independence was declared from British rule. His  pursuit of socialist "Ujamaa" policies would hinder Tanzanian economic growth but would spare the young republic from disunity and the tribalism that plagues therest of the  continent. Once he stepped down from power ten years ago, his successors would introduce a multi-party system and likewise economic deregulation. Tanzania still attains good ties  with the PRC but is mostly seen as a neutral actor on the world stage.Now with Nyerere wistfully passing away 3 months ago, many Tanzanians look back with nostalgia. But many more  also look into the future for opportunity and hope for change."

 TNZ.6.d: "Nearly all of Tanzania is dirt-poor just like the rest of Africa. Still the top 10% of our citizenry holds unequal economic influence in our society, and their power only  grows by the day. If we would meet their demands we could easily have theirbacking and stability would be secured."

 TNZ.8.t: "Meeting with the religious leaders"
 TNZ.8.d: "Tanzania has a massive religious following, with more than 2/3 being christians and the other 1/3rd is made up of many minority religions but the biggest one being Islam.  Giving their religous leaders more independency would centainly make them fallinto the fold."

Out on the streets countless protests thegovernment in its recent attemps to reach out to the americans for a possible US military base on the  mainland.

 TNZ.13.t: "Settle the Malawi border dispute"
 TNZ.13.d: "Relations between Malawi and Tanzania has been frosty at best, and it boils down to the dispute over where the border goes along the lake Malawi. The Tanzanian side claims  that the border runs straight through the middle of the lake. Meanwhile theMalawi's claim that the whole of the lake is theirs that is not Mozambique, including right up to the shore  on the Tanzanian side. \n\nThis goes back to the Heligoland Treaty of 1890 when Germany and Great Britain partitioned the region. The british after WorldWar 1 captured Tanganyika and  put all of the waters of the lake under a single jurisdiction, that of the Malawians. It was later still under colonial times that two jurisdictions were established. Since  independence both sides has been at eachother over thisdispute without being able to produce a settlement. \n\nNow we have yet again put it on the agenda to make justice on the  matter, but many experts are expecting that not much will be achieved and that relations between the two nations will stay the same."

We believe that the waters of the lake is all  ours except those parts of Mozambique. They are not backing up their claims with anything, but we should expect that relations will not be better between our twonations."
 TNZ.14.a: "We have nothing to lose"
 TNZ.14.b: "We give up on our ambitions"
 TNZ.15.t: "Malawi response"
 TNZ.15.d: "The Malawi government has given a statement to our diplomats with a lenghty, but devoid of substance, reply to our claims. They still refer to the old Heligoland Treaty  and that their current position stays the same. Nothing has been resolved."
 TNZ.15.a: "Atleast it was worth a try"
 TNZ.16.t: "Tanzanians pressures claim"
 TNZ.16.d: "Tanzanian delegates have come down to the capital building to give to our government "shortest possible time" to back down our claim over the Lake Malawi. Just an hour  later reports comes in that nearly all the media in Tanzania has been announcingthis new aggresive stance against our position. This is surely a beginning of something that cannot  end well."
 TNZ.16.a: "We will not be intimidated"
 TNZ.16.b: "We must back down for peace"
 TNZ.17.t: "Malawi response"

 TNZ.20.t: "The Comoros Compromise"
 TNZ.20.d: "The Comoros islands has been firmly under our control and has near to no chance of leaving us now. However they retain a huge amount of autonomy but its not sure if it  will go well to infringe on that autonomy without consulting their leaders. We havenow decided to meet and talk to their representatives to amend the constitution regarding the  future of Comoros in our one nation."
 TNZ.20.a: "We will have the people on our side"
 TNZ.21.t: "Democracy in Comoros"
 TNZ.21.d: "In the last two weeks our forces in South East Tanzania has been reallocated to Mohéli, the smallest but closest island to Anjouan in Comoros. There a coalition of African  Union members and help from french logistics prepaired to retake Anjouan byforce. \n\nEarlier this morning the order was given to embark and scout the beachheads, and with minimal  resistance the coalition forces started to move all their forces to the island. First shots could be heard around 5 a.m. but the local military wasoverwhealmed by the coalition forces with no casualties on the coalition side. Both the airfield and main seaport, nearly all coastal towns fell under occupation by dawn with scenes of jubilation from the local population. By mid-day however the main palace wasdeserted. Mohamed Bacar had fled into the jungles early reports suggested. However later reports stated that Bacar fled the island seeking exile in the french controlled island of Mayotte."

 TNZ.37.t: "New Strategic Partner"

The positives would be that we now have  completed a string of bases right through the Indian Ocean, from Australia to DiegoGarcia to the Tanzanian coast. The negatives would be that they ask in return that we guarantee  them in case war would be declared upon them. Other alternative is just to get naval access to their ports but it would limit our operational capacity in the region.Either way this  could very well be a new chapter in new American-Tanzanian relations."

The announcement ended with her declaring 14 days of national mourning and ordering all flags to fly half-staff nationwide.\n\nIn the recent weeks, Magufuli's whereabouts hasn't been known to the public. This in effect has led many to speculate on his condition and a few, more sinister conspiracies to grow. There has been especially harsh rhetoric coming from opposition leaders who also early on claimed he was dying.\n\nAt any rate, the Vice-President is now expected to very soon take the oath of office. This will mark many firsts not only in Tanzania but East Africa too."
