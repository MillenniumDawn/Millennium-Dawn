 narcos_crisis_desc: "Our government's authority has been severely undermined by rampant corruption and organized criminal activity. The cartels have infiltrated critical institutions, compromising our ability to enforce laws and maintain the state's monopoly on violence. Intelligence reports indicate we are on the brink of either a military coup orchestrated by cartel-aligned officers or a coordinated armed uprising by the cartels themselves. Immediate action is required to prevent the complete collapse of state authority."

The mafia has infiltrated key institutions, compromising our ability to enforce laws and maintain the state's monopoly on violence. Intelligence reports indicate we are on the brink of either a military coup orchestrated by mafia-aligned officers or a coordinated armed uprising by criminal organizations. Immediate and decisive action is required to prevent the complete collapse of state authority."
 mexican_cartel_war: "Guerra de Cárteles en México"
 mexican_cartel_war_desc: "La capacidad de nuestro gobierno para hacer cumplir las leyes y monopolizar la fuerza se ha visto comprometida debido a la creciente corrupción y actividad delictiva. Nuestro propio ejército y nuestra infraestructura política han sido completamente infiltrados y ya no se puede confiar en nadie. El caos pronto alcanzará su punto máximo y entonces estaremos en medio de una nueva guerra civil."
 anti_cartel_propaganda_decision: "Propaganda Anti-Cárteles"
 anti_cartel_propaganda_decision_desc: "There has always been a growing myth surrounding the cartels, that they are like the banditos of the rose-tinted past. Lovable rogues that may do bad things but only do them for the good of their people. Like all myths, it is a fabrication. One that anyone living under the influence of the cartels knows to be false. By exposing the horrors inflicted by them upon their own in a nation-wide media campaign, we can work towards dispelling this myth once and for all."
 police_investments_decision: "Inversión en la Policía"
 police_investments_decision_desc: "Criminal organizations like the cartels are sophisticated enterprises with extensive resources, financing, and weaponry. They cannot be deterred with minimal force or standard policing methods. Our police forces stand as the primary defense against these organizations, yet they frequently lack the resources to counter the extreme violence they face. While militarizing our police carries certain societal costs, providing them with enhanced equipment, advanced tactical training, and increased personnel is essential for creating an effective barrier against cartel operations. This transformation requires significant financial investment, but is necessary to establish the security foundation our nation needs to combat organized crime effectively."
 utilize_the_military_decisions: "Utilizar al Ejército"
 utilize_the_military_decisions_desc: "While our police forces may be well-equipped, they remain constrained by limited manpower, local bureaucracy, and potential corruption. Deploying military forces provides us with superior firepower, a robust command structure, and extensive resources that can bypass local administrative obstacles. The military's national organization allows for coordinated operations across regions where cartels operate. However, this approach comes with significant drawbacks: civilians often fear military presence in their communities, local police may resent the implied inadequacy of their efforts, and civilian infrastructure can suffer damage during operations. Military deployment also risks human rights concerns and may undermine public trust in government institutions. We must carefully weigh the tactical advantages against the potential loss of public support and legitimacy."
 target_cartel_money_laundering_decision: "Atacar las Operaciones de Lavado de Dinero de los Cárteles"
 target_cartel_money_laundering_decision_desc: "Cartels must launder their illicit profits to acquire legitimate assets, transforming 'dirty money' through a three-stage process: placement into the financial system, layering to obscure origins, and integration into legal holdings. These laundered funds enable them to purchase property, businesses, and influence government officials. By targeting the layering and integration phases, we can disrupt their financial infrastructure and stem corruption. This involves methodical investigation and shutdown of complicit financial institutions and shell companies. However, this strategy carries significant risk—failed operations may provoke violent retaliation as cartels defend their cash flow, potentially intensifying their hostility toward government forces and civilians alike."
 investigate_the_casinos: "Investigar los Casinos"
 investigate_the_casinos_desc: "Casinos operate in a regulatory gray area, making them ideal entry points for laundering illicit funds. Their high cash turnover creates an environment where large sums can be processed without raising suspicion, appearing both anonymous and legitimate. Our strategy will involve identifying establishments frequented by known cartel associates and conducting thorough audits of their financial operations. By meticulously tracing suspicious transactions and establishing direct links to criminal organizations, we can build airtight cases against these fronts. Once sufficient evidence is gathered, we'll execute coordinated raids to shut down these operations and seize their assets, dealing a significant blow to the cartels' financial infrastructure while recovering funds for the state."
 investigates_the_banks: "Investigar los Bancos"
 investigates_the_banks_desc: "Banks, though typically legitimate institutions, are critical conduits in sophisticated money laundering operations. Through strategic investigation of senior banking officials and financial analysts, combined with comprehensive analysis of transaction records, we can intercept suspicious fund movements before they're completed. By exercising patience and surveillance, we can strike when illicit funds reach their maximum concentration—typically as they approach their final destination. This approach inflicts maximum financial damage on criminal organizations while removing substantial capital from their operations. However, maintaining effective monitoring presents significant challenges, as criminal enterprises continuously evolve their methods to circumvent detection. Furthermore, shutting down implicated banking institutions remains politically unfeasible due to their economic importance and powerful connections."
 investigate_shell_companies: "Investigar las Empresas Fantasma"
 investigate_shell_companies_desc: "Shell companies serve as crucial intermediaries in sophisticated money laundering operations, functioning as both midpoint and final repositories for criminal assets. These legal entities hold property and capital on behalf of cartels while gradually transferring these assets toward legitimate destinations. They present a significant investigative challenge, as establishing direct connections to criminal organizations requires extensive financial forensics and intelligence gathering. Despite this difficulty, successfully targeting shell companies can devastatingly disrupt a cartel's financial infrastructure. Rather than yielding large cash seizures, these operations typically result in the confiscation of substantial physical assets—commercial real estate, luxury vehicles, industrial equipment, and legally acquired weapons—as criminals typically move money through these fronts in smaller, consistent transactions designed to avoid detection."
 target_cartel_drug_running_decision: "Operaciones contra el narcotráfico"
 target_cartel_drug_running_decision_desc: "Drug-running operations constitute the largest illegal revenue source for cartels. While some cartels cultivate drugs themselves, many generate profits by moving refined or unrefined products through the supply chain. By systematically targeting and monitoring these transportation routes, we can identify origin points, destinations, and transit hubs. This intelligence enables us to conduct strategic raids on equipment depots, refineries, farms, drug houses, and operational bases. Alternatively, we can intercept shipments in transit, though this approach typically proves ineffective against larger operations. However, it can significantly destabilize smaller groups with limited resources to recover from such losses."
 raid_drug_convoys_decision: "Asaltar Convoyes de Drogas"
 raid_drug_convoys_decision_desc: "Intercepting drug convoys in transit allows us to efficiently disrupt supply chains with minimal operational costs. While major cartels possess the resources to quickly adapt their routes and transportation methods, smaller organizations are particularly vulnerable to these operations. The sudden loss of product and revenue can devastate their financial stability, often triggering internal conflicts as leadership struggles to maintain control amid dwindling resources. These targeted interdictions provide high-visibility successes that demonstrate government action while simultaneously exploiting divisions within criminal hierarchies."
 raid_cartel_hideouts_decision: "Asaltar Escondites de Carteles"
 raid_cartel_hideouts_decision_desc: "Targeting cartel strongholds and supply depots directly disrupts their operational infrastructure, severely limiting their capacity to transport narcotics, coordinate activities, and defend their territory. These raids typically yield significant seizures of tactical vehicles and weaponry that would otherwise be deployed against government forces or rival organizations. A strategic consequence of these operations is the potential destabilization of cartel power dynamics—weakened organizations often become targets for territorial expansion by competitors, which can either fragment criminal networks to our advantage or trigger escalated violence as power vacuums emerge."
 raid_distribution_centres_decision: "Asaltar Centros de Distribución"
 raid_distribution_centres_decision_desc: "Targeting cartel distribution centers—including drug houses and stockpiles—allows us to intercept substantial quantities of narcotics before they reach the streets. These operations yield significant seizures of illicit cash and result in the arrest of key distribution personnel, disrupting the supply chain for weeks or months. However, these raids carry heightened risk of violent retaliation, as they directly impact cartel profits while leaving their enforcement capabilities intact. Intelligence gathering before such operations is critical, as distribution centers are typically well-guarded and strategically positioned to facilitate quick dispersal of products and personnel."
 raid_refinement_centres_decision: "Asaltar Centros de Refinamiento"
 raid_refinement_centres_decision_desc: "Al asaltar laboratorios, plantaciones o casas de cultivo de drogas, podemos inhibir la capacidad del cártel de crear nuevas drogas para distribuirlas y, al mismo tiempo, hacerles perder mucho dinero. Este revés suele ser suficiente para obstaculizar su producción durante meses mientras intentan recuperar las pérdidas. Al mismo tiempo, es poco probable que se produzca un ataque de represalia, ya que la mayoría de los recursos del cártel se destinan a proteger su territorio."
 target_local_cartel_leaders_decision: "Atacar a Líderes Locales del Cartel"
 target_local_cartel_leaders_decision_desc: "Cartels, like any sophisticated organization, rely on a hierarchical leadership structure to coordinate their operations. By strategically targeting and neutralizing local cartel leaders—whether through arrests or more permanent means—we can severely disrupt their command chain. This destabilization produces multiple benefits: recruitment efforts falter without proper direction, operational capacity diminishes significantly, and internal power struggles erupt as subordinates compete for vacant leadership positions. Additionally, these high-profile captures or eliminations generate substantial positive media coverage, boosting public morale and demonstrating the government's effectiveness in combating organized crime. Each successful operation against these figures not only weakens the cartel's infrastructure but also erodes their perceived invincibility."

 cartel_event.31.a: "Excelente."
 cartel_event.32.t: "El vecino ignora nuestras demandas"
 cartel_event.32.d: "Nuestro vecino, [FROM.GetName], ha ignorado nuestras demandas de un mayor control fronterizo. Ya estamos siendo criticados por los medios de comunicación debido a nuestro fracaso político."
 cartel_event.32.a: "Lamentable."
 cartel_event.33.t: "Transferencias sospechosas vinculadas a un oligarca"
 cartel_event.33.d: "Durante una de nuestras recientes investigaciones, descubrimos transferencias de dinero sospechosas, aunque no ilegales, desde el fondo de un cierto oligarca dentro de nuestro país. Sería fácil engrasar los engranajes políticos para implicarlos en nuestra reciente investigación. Sin embargo, tal extralimitación sin duda enfurecería a los oligarcas tanto extranjeros como nacionales."
 cartel_event.33.a: "Incautemos sus activos."
 cartel_event.33.b: "Déjalos en paz."
 cartel_event.34.t: "Tanque del cartel avistado"
 cartel_event.34.d: "Durante una reciente e infructuosa incursión contra un objetivo de los cárteles, se avistó un tanque que los cárteles utilizaban. Parecía ser un T-34 soviético muy modificado, e incluso era capaz de disparar su cañón principal."
 cartel_event.34.a: "Deberíamos hacer algo al respecto."
 cartel_event.35.t: "Tanque del cartel destruido"
 cartel_event.35.d: "Durante una reciente redada exitosa contra un objetivo del cártel, nuestros agentes lograron localizar y destruir el T-34 que se vio durante uno de nuestros recientes fracasos. La victoria, especialmente porque se llevó a cabo sin armas antitanque, ha recibido mucha publicidad en las noticias."
 cartel_event.35.a: "Gracias a Dios y a nuestros valientes hombres."
 cartel_event.36.t: "Tanque del cartel utilizado en ataque"
 cartel_event.36.d: "Como represalia tras uno de nuestros recientes ataques, los carteles realizaron un ataque contra una de nuestras comisarías de policía. Destrozaron el edificio, utilizando un T-34 avistado recientemente para derribar la cerca y disparar indiscriminadamente contra el edificio. Esto ha provocado un número significativo de víctimas y el incidente ha llegado a las noticias nacionales."
 cartel_event.36.a: "Deberíamos hacer algo al respecto."
 cartel_event.37.t: "Empresa de transporte como fachada"
 cartel_event.37.d: "Al evaluar los activos de una de las empresas que incautamos recientemente, se observó que una de ellas estaba registrada con una gran cantidad de antiguos camiones militares 6x6. Después de una breve búsqueda, se localizaron los vehículos en un almacén propiedad de la empresa. Los vehículos ahora se utilizan comúnmente en granjas y en una variedad de otras industrias, pero también se siguen utilizando en algunas funciones heredadas dentro de nuestro ejército."
 cartel_event.37.a: "Incorpóralos al servicio militar."
 cartel_event.37.b: "Vende los camiones a empresas civiles."
 cartel_event.38.t: "Se arresta accidentalmente a un señor del crimen"
 cartel_event.38.d: "Una reciente serie de arrestos de lo que se creía que eran solo miembros de cárteles de bajo nivel resultó haber atrapado por accidente a un importante jefe del crimen. Aunque inicialmente ocultó su identidad, fue reconocido por un oficial de policía que estaba familiarizado con el hombre. Ahora exige su liberación y ofrece pagar una fianza sustancial."
 cartel_event.38.a: "Ah, sí, todo parte del plan."
 cartel_event.38.b: "Lamento mucho eso, señor."
 cartel_event.39.t: "Las autoridades tropiezan con una plantación de drogas"
 cartel_event.39.d: "Durante una patrulla de rutina en el campo de nuestro país, la policía local se topó con lo que creen que es una plantación de drogas. Siguiendo el protocolo, han informado de la noticia a sus superiores y ahora están esperando refuerzos o asesoramiento sobre qué hacer."
 cartel_event.39.a: "Quemen los campos y destruyan el equipo."
 cartel_event.39.b: "Incauten cualquier evidencia o equipo."
 cartel_event.39.c: "Dejen la plantación como está."
 cartel_event.40.t: "Informante anónimo"
 cartel_event.40.d: "Hemos recibido un aviso anónimo sobre un puesto de avanzada vulnerable de un cártel. Si actuamos rápidamente, podríamos tomar el control de la posición. Sin embargo, esto podría ser una broma o una estratagema de los cárteles para sacarnos de posición y tendernos una emboscada."
 cartel_event.40.a: "Actúen según la pista, ¡cualquier oportunidad es real!"
 cartel_event.40.b: "Ignoren la pista, probablemente sea una broma."
 cartel_event.41.t: "Negocios locales cooperan con los carteles"
 cartel_event.41.d: "Se ha descubierto que varias empresas de una de nuestras ciudades periféricas colaboran con los cárteles, a veces incluso abiertamente. Permitir que esto continúe envía un mensaje claro a nuestro pueblo de que no estamos dispuestos a gobernar o no podemos hacerlo. Pero a los cárteles les envía un mensaje de que respetamos su autoridad para hacerlo."
 cartel_event.41.a: "Reprima a los propietarios por sus acciones."
 cartel_event.41.b: "Haga la vista gorda ante la actividad."
 cartel_event.42.t: "Conglomerados industriales albergando contrabando"
 cartel_event.42.d: "Recientemente nos enteramos, a través de un chivatazo, de que muchas de nuestras empresas más importantes han permitido que los cárteles utilicen sus almacenes para almacenar contrabando. Si bien esto puede ser un signo de corrupción flagrante, existe la posibilidad de que haya sido el resultado de un chantaje. En cualquier caso, es necesario algún tipo de respuesta por nuestra parte. De lo contrario, es probable que el chivato salga en los medios."
 cartel_event.42.a: "¡Incauten los almacenes y multen a los conglomerados!"
 cartel_event.42.b: "Incauten el contrabando y den una advertencia a las empresas."
 cartel_event.42.c: "Son sus almacenes, pero ahora todos lo saben."
 cartel_event.43.t: "Funcionarios corruptos"
 cartel_event.43.d: "Recientemente hemos recibido una pista anónima que dio lugar a una breve investigación sobre las inversiones de campaña de uno de nuestros políticos locales. La investigación reveló que la mayoría de los fondos de campaña habían procedido de personas y empresas vinculadas a actividades de cártel. Muchos indicios de la investigación también apuntan a una intrincada red de personas designadas, inversores y aliados políticos."
 cartel_event.43.a: "Remuevan del cargo a tantos como sea posible, no podemos tolerar esto."
 cartel_event.43.b: "Las inversiones en campañas de ciudadanos privados no nos conciernen."
 cartel_event.44.t: "Autoridad portuaria encuentra contrabando"
 cartel_event.44.d: "En uno de nuestros principales puertos, nuestra autoridad portuaria descubrió un contenedor de envío lleno de contrabando durante una búsqueda de rutina. De acuerdo con el protocolo, han incautado temporalmente el barco mientras nos pasan la decisión de qué hacer con él."
 cartel_event.44.a: "Incauten el barco por colaborar en el tráfico de drogas."
 cartel_event.44.b: "Incauten el contenedor, es lo único ilegal aquí."
 cartel_event.44.c: "Dejen pasar esto, los negocios son negocios."
 cartel_event.45.t: "Banqueros hacen la vista gorda"
 cartel_event.45.d: "Hemos recibido un aviso anónimo de que varios banqueros de alto rango han estado haciendo la vista gorda ante las actividades de los cárteles y, en ocasiones, incluso participando en ellas. Si no hacemos algo con esta información, es probable que el informante la filtre a los medios de comunicación."
 cartel_event.45.a: "Encarcelen a los banqueros en cuestión y abran una investigación."
 cartel_event.45.b: "Está fuera de nuestras manos..."
 cartel_event.46.t: "Sobornos tentadores de los carteles"
 cartel_event.46.d: "Recientemente, a varios miembros de nuestro establishment político se les ha presentado una propuesta interesante: tratamos a los cárteles como a cualquier otro grupo de interés, les damos espacio para que operen como les plazca y ellos financian varias elecciones importantes que se avecinan. Los miembros más ideológicamente maleables esperan que les orientemos."
 cartel_event.46.a: "¡Por supuesto! Estamos encantados de trabajar con un grupo de interés tan importante."
 cartel_event.46.b: "¡Escandaloso! No representan los mejores intereses del pueblo."
 cartel_event.47.t: "Tratos con los demonios"
 cartel_event.47.d: "Varios miembros de alto rango de nuestro establishment político fueron invitados recientemente a una reunión con los líderes de uno de los cárteles más grandes de nuestro país. Durante la reunión, los líderes del cártel dejaron claras sus intenciones. No necesitan ser nuestros enemigos; de hecho, podríamos ser aliados políticos. Ya han ofrecido una parte sustancial del pastel a cambio de nuestra cooperación y prometen ofrecer más a medida que nuestra asociación continúe."
 cartel_event.47.a: "Los impuestos son una parte importante de la capacidad de funcionamiento de un estado."
 cartel_event.47.b: "No podemos dejar que esos demonios ni siquiera pongan un pie en la puerta."
 cartel_event.48.t: "Regular el comercio de drogas"
 cartel_event.48.d: "Recientemente, varios cárteles importantes han presentado una oferta para cooperar en la reducción de los delitos no relacionados con los cárteles, que han comenzado a reducir sus márgenes de beneficio. A cambio, han ofrecido cooperar para que sus empresas afiliadas presenten informes de beneficios más precisos y para que su actividad sea más humana, sea lo que sea lo que eso signifique."
 cartel_event.48.a: "Negociar una cooperación estrictamente regulada entre el estado y los carteles."
 cartel_event.48.b: "Negociar una cooperación laxamente regulada entre el estado y los carteles."
 cartel_event.48.c: "No negociamos con criminales."
 cartel_event.49.t: "La juventud pierde fe"
 cartel_event.49.d: "Uno de los subgrupos más maleables de nuestra población son nuestros jóvenes, y la situación de nuestra nación con los cárteles ha comenzado a ponerlos en contra de nuestro establishment político. Si bien las encuestas indican que muchos planean irse una vez que sean capaces de hacerlo, aquellos que planean quedarse parecen decididos a votar en contra de nosotros en las próximas elecciones. Intentamos implementar un programa de divulgación para tratar de canalizar a los más entusiastas entre ellos para que arreglen su país de origen con nosotros."
 cartel_event.49.a: "Extender nuestra mano con un programa de alcance."
 cartel_event.49.b: "Dejemos que se hundan en su propia autocompasión, no los necesitamos."
 cartel_event.53.t: "Ataque de represalia del cartel"
 cartel_event.53.d: "Tras una de nuestras redadas recientes, los cárteles llevaron a cabo un ataque de represalia contra una de nuestras comisarías. Consiguieron traspasar el perímetro y expulsar a nuestros agentes de la ciudad, dejando un rastro de destrucción a su paso. Esto ha provocado varias víctimas, mientras que el incidente ha llegado a los medios de comunicación nacionales."
 cartel_event.53.a: "Lamentable."
 cartel_event.54.t: "Fracaso del ataque de represalia del cartel"
 cartel_event.54.d: "Tras una de nuestras recientes redadas, los cárteles llevaron a cabo un ataque de represalia contra una de nuestras comisarías. Nuestros agentes resistieron valientemente y sólo sufrieron unas pocas bajas. Después de unas horas, recibieron refuerzos y lograron dispersar a los cárteles. El incidente se ha convertido en un punto de encuentro contra los cárteles en los medios nacionales."
 cartel_event.54.a: "Excelente."
 cartel_event.55.t: "Los carteles derriban un helicóptero"
 cartel_event.55.d: "Durante una redada reciente, uno de nuestros helicópteros policiales fue derribado por los cárteles. Una revisión del incidente reveló que una bala perdida alcanzó al piloto en el cuello, lo que provocó el accidente catastrófico porque el copiloto no pudo recuperar el control a tiempo. Perder un equipo tan importante, por no hablar de su tripulación, es una vergüenza."
 cartel_event.55.a: "Lamentable."
 cartel_event.56.t: "Superviviente de una ejecución del cartel"
 cartel_event.56.d: "Un hombre de una de las regiones infestadas de cárteles de nuestro país, encontrado por un buen samaritano y llevado de urgencia al hospital, se encuentra ahora en lo que pronto podría ser su lecho de muerte. Sin embargo, se nos presenta la oportunidad de ayudarlo. Necesita ser trasladado a un hospital con mejores instalaciones, algo que uno de nuestros helicópteros militares cercanos podría lograr."
 cartel_event.56.a: "¡Se convertirá en nuestro nuevo El Fusilado!"
 cartel_event.56.b: "Es una lástima que nuestros médicos no pudieran salvarlo..."
 cartel_event.50.t1: "Exitosas investigaciones de casinos"
 cartel_event.50.d1: "Después de semanas de planificación y seguimiento, nuestras fuerzas policiales entraron en uno de los casinos de nuestro país, incautaron millones de dólares en dinero sucio, recogieron pruebas físicas importantes y arrestaron a los principales participantes del plan de lavado de dinero del cártel. Con las pruebas reunidas, congelamos todos los activos legítimos vinculados al casino y sus operadores. Con este golpe, eliminamos una importante pieza de infraestructura y obstaculizamos su capacidad de acumular fondos utilizables."
 cartel_event.50.t2: "Exitosas investigaciones bancarias"
 cartel_event.50.d2: "Tras semanas de espera y seguimiento de las transferencias de dinero, hoy hemos congelado los activos de media docena de empresas e individuos vinculados a una operación de blanqueo de dinero de un cártel. Se han emitido órdenes de arresto y se han iniciado múltiples investigaciones menores sobre transferencias sospechosas entre algunas de las empresas y políticos y burócratas de bajo nivel. Aunque los cárteles se recuperarán inevitablemente, la pérdida de tanto dinero de golpe será un duro golpe para su infraestructura."
 cartel_event.50.t3: "Exitosas investigaciones de empresas ficticias"
 cartel_event.50.d3: "Tras semanas de investigación, hemos cerrado varias empresas sospechosas y hemos confiscado sus activos en el proceso. Si bien se ha recaudado muy poco dinero, hemos confiscado una gran cantidad de propiedades, vehículos civiles y otros bienes. Esto debería ser un duro golpe, no solo para su operación de lavado de dinero, sino también para su capacidad de mantener todas sus operaciones."
 cartel_event.50.t4: "Investigaciones de casinos fallidas"
 cartel_event.50.d4: "A pesar de nuestros mejores esfuerzos, nuestros analistas no han podido establecer una conexión entre los cárteles y el casino sobre el que recae nuestra investigación. Lo que es peor, la gente ha comenzado a hacer preguntas sobre el destino del dinero utilizado en la investigación, lo que ha dado lugar a ataques políticos exitosos contra nuestros candidatos por parte de la oposición. Para colmo de males, los cárteles siguen con sus operaciones sin ningún obstáculo."
 cartel_event.50.t5: "Investigaciones bancarias fallidas"
 cartel_event.50.d5: "A pesar de las semanas que nuestros agentes han pasado encorvados frente a las computadoras y monitoreando las transferencias bancarias, no hemos tenido ninguna oportunidad clara de asestar un golpe a los cárteles. Lo que es peor, la gente ha comenzado a hacer preguntas sobre el destino del dinero utilizado en la investigación, lo que ha llevado a que la oposición haya logrado ataques políticos contra nuestros candidatos. Para colmo de males, los cárteles continúan con sus operaciones sin obstáculos."
 cartel_event.50.t6: "Investigaciones de empresas ficticias fallidas"
 cartel_event.50.d6: "A pesar del tiempo y el dinero que hemos invertido en nuestras investigaciones, lo único que hemos descubierto son fondos de garantía para divorcios y esquemas de protección de responsabilidades. Lo que es peor, en el proceso hemos logrado pisotear a la cantidad justa de gente para que nuestra investigación saliera a la luz en los medios nacionales. Es muy probable que semejante bochorno haya perjudicado nuestras futuras perspectivas electorales. Para colmo de males, los cárteles continúan con sus operaciones sin impedimentos."
 cartel_event.50.a: "La investigación concluida"
 cartel_event.51.t1: "Exitoso ataque a un convoy de drogas"
 cartel_event.51.d1: "En un reciente ataque a lo largo de una conocida ruta de tráfico de drogas, logramos incautar cientos de kilogramos de drogas, arrestar a varios miembros de bajo nivel de un cártel y confiscar varios vehículos civiles con pocas víctimas. Esto debería ser suficiente para detener el tráfico por un corto tiempo, pero estas pérdidas pueden ser absorbidas fácilmente por cualquier cártel lo suficientemente grande."
 cartel_event.51.t2: "Exitoso ataque a un escondite del cartel"
 cartel_event.51.d2: "En un reciente ataque a un conocido bastión del cártel, logramos matar o arrestar a docenas de miembros del cártel y confiscamos o destruimos varias piezas de equipo militar utilizable y armas improvisadas. Este golpe podría tener un efecto dominó, ya que otras organizaciones intentarán aprovechar la debilidad momentánea."
 cartel_event.51.t3: "Exitoso ataque a centros de distribución"
 cartel_event.51.d3: "En un reciente ataque a un conocido centro de distribución, logramos incautar cientos de miles de dólares en dinero sucio y drogas. También hemos comenzado a detener a numerosos traficantes de drogas vinculados al lugar, lo que ha obstaculizado seriamente su capacidad de introducir drogas en el mercado y obtener ganancias. A pesar de nuestro éxito, debemos tener cuidado con la posibilidad de un ataque de represalia."
 cartel_event.51.t4: "Exitoso ataque a centros de refinamiento"
 cartel_event.51.d4: "En un reciente ataque a un conocido centro de refinación, logramos destruir equipos y drogas por valor de cientos de miles de dólares. También logramos arrestar a muchas de las personas involucradas en la refinación, lo que las pondrá en desventaja a la hora de producir más drogas en el futuro. A pesar de nuestro éxito, debemos tener cuidado con la posibilidad de un ataque de represalia."
 cartel_event.51.t5: "Fallido ataque a un convoy de drogas"
 cartel_event.51.d5: "En un reciente intento de ataque en una conocida ruta de tráfico de drogas, nuestras fuerzas se vieron superadas y se vieron obligadas a retirarse, dejando atrás varias víctimas. La información sobre el incidente ya se ha filtrado al público, lo que ha reducido la confianza en nuestro gobierno. Debemos tener cuidado ante la posibilidad de un ataque de represalia."
 cartel_event.51.t6: "Fallido ataque a un escondite del cartel"
 cartel_event.51.d6: "En un reciente intento de ataque contra un conocido bastión de un cártel, nuestras fuerzas se vieron superadas y se vieron obligadas a retirarse, dejando atrás varias bajas.

 cartel_event.51.t7: "Fallido ataque a centros de distribución"
 cartel_event.51.d7: "En un reciente intento de ataque contra un conocido centro de distribución de un cártel, nuestras fuerzas se vieron superadas y se vieron obligadas a retirarse, dejando atrás varias víctimas. La información sobre el incidente ya se ha filtrado al público, lo que ha reducido la confianza en nuestro gobierno. A estas alturas, todos los que tenían relación con el lugar se han dispersado. Debemos tener cuidado con la posibilidad de un ataque de represalia."
 cartel_event.51.t8: "Fallido ataque a centros de refinamiento"
 cartel_event.51.d8: "En un reciente intento de ataque contra un conocido centro de refinación de un cártel, nuestras fuerzas se vieron superadas y se vieron obligadas a retirarse, dejando atrás varias víctimas. La información sobre el incidente ya se ha filtrado al público, lo que ha reducido la confianza en nuestro gobierno. Debemos tener cuidado ante la posibilidad de un ataque de represalia."

 cartel_event.52.t: "El fin de los carteles"
 cartel_event.52.d: "Tras décadas de lucha y el sacrificio de muchos, hemos eliminado de nuestro país cualquier resto de los cárteles. Sin embargo, aún no estamos a salvo de su influencia.
