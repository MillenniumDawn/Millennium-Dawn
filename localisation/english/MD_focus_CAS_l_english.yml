  ##### Events #####
  ##################
cascadia_event.1.t: "The Resistance Rises"
cascadia_event.1.d: "Since the early days of our formation the state of Idaho has been giving us...trouble to say the least. Being the most isolated out of the three states, many within Idaho believe it would be safer and easier to just be their own entity. We don't believe it'll go anywhere but with the continued agitation many are a bit fearful of a potential conflict so soon after the chaos and anarchy which came before."
cascadia_event.1.o1: "Can't Catch A Break"
cascadia_event.2.t: "Crime Wave"
cascadia_event.2.d: "There has been a rising crime wave plaguing the state of Idaho, while this could be just hiccups in restoring over all law and order. There are just some people who are concerned for the implications this could mean. While there is no clear evidence some citizens and even ministers are prying at the government to send in a special investigative squad to secure the situation."
cascadia_event.2.o1: "Local Police Can handle This"
cascadia_event.2.o2: "Someone Get Me The Numbers On RMR Membership"
cascadia_event.3.t: "Rocky Mountain Marches"
cascadia_event.3.d: "The group known as the Rocky Mountain Resistance has begun to organize marches. While there is nothing illegal about it the rising membership of the group is causing concerns throughout Olympia. As such an order has been issued by the national government to begin a subtle mobilization as fears continue to rise over the Idaho situation."
cascadia_event.3.o1: "It Never Ends"
cascadia_event.4.t: "The Rise Of Mountain Man"
cascadia_event.4.d: "The Rocky Mountain Resistance has taken the state of Idaho and with it the leader of the group has come out. A suffed man nationed Robert \"Mountain Man\" Johnson. While he doesn't look like much, he and his group have done what many had hoped to avoid in these very young days of our nation. As such we must set forth and mobilize the nation to ensure this is handled before the world itself decides to interfere with us anymore then they've likely tried to already."
cascadia_event.4.o1: "God Help Us"
cascadia_event.5.t: "We March"
cascadia_event.5.d: "The time has come to settle this, we march through the mountains and assume the peace we have so longed for."
cascadia_event.5.o1: "We Go TO War!"
cascadia_event.300.t: "Special Investigation Unit Arrives"
cascadia_event.300.d: "A while ago after much pleading with the government in Olympia, the government dispatched a SIU to the state of Idaho. Initial investigations proved only crumbs. However as time progressed slowly co-opted crime sprees were uncovered and soon members of the RMR were detained and thankfully arrested for committing said crimes."
cascadia_event.300.o1: "Well That's Something At Least"
cascadia_event.301.t: "Crime Decreases"
cascadia_event.301.d: "As the SIU and local law enforcement continue to handle the crime wave and more and more members of the RMR are being arrested for arms theft and a plethora of other crimes. Membership numbers are beginning to dwindle as things begin to look up for the stability for the state of Idaho, many wonder just when it'll all come to a peaceable end."
cascadia_event.301.o1: "Hopefully Sooner Rather Than Later"
cascadia_event.302.t: "Continued Efforts"
cascadia_event.302.d: "As time progresses the SIU has taken more of an advisor and assistance role as local law enforcement has been given more and more operational control over the situation. Crime continues to decrease and RMR memberships have reached an all time low. Rumors have it that their leader, known simply as \"Mountain Man\", is slated to give a speech in the following days. This comes as leadership in the SIU are debating if it is finally time to leave the state as law and order seems to be mostly restored."
cascadia_event.302.o1: "It's Taken Some Time But It Was Worth It"
cascadia_event.303.t: "Peace Restored"
cascadia_event.303.d: "Earlier today the leader of the RMR announced the offical disbandment of the group. Many members were outraged but were so disheartened that they just retreated back to their homes. Local law enforcement states that crime is at an all time low and stability has once more restored itself to the state of Idaho. Now we can begin to move forward together as one nation."

cascadian_politics_event.1.t: "Spoiled For Choices"
cascadian_politics_event.1.d: "As the nation gears up for its first national election, many are setting out to create their own political parties and so forth. The real question is, what direction do the people really want to take. It's hard to say in these early stages but so far elements from parties like the armed force, Boise Business Party and the Red Mountain Party seem to be gaining traction, though it seems to be doing more to divie up the political pie of the voting population rather than presumably consolidating their own partys' stength. But who knows, they do say the early bird gets the worm, so who knows."
cascadian_politics_event.1.o1: "God, Who Do I Choose?"
cascadian_politics_event.2.t: "Cutting The Cake"
cascadian_politics_event.2.d: "As voting booths and designated voting areas are being created as well as in general the setup of the voting process to conduct the election itself. The people of the nation have begun to consolidate into political parties and different kinds of outlooks on how to go forward with our nation. Some seek to keep the true western democratic principles, some seek to look more towards autocracy or socialism and the over all influences of the east, others just want to take a good look at ourselves and not use other nations as a basis and instead use the principles of their ideology for our nation. A sort of Cascadian centric outlook if you will, finally there are those that also seek to be more firm and authoritative, taking the Cascadian centric idea and being more nationalistic. Whatever the case may be, the election is still some time out."
cascadian_politics_event.2.o1: "Western Principles Shall Guide Us To Prosperity"
cascadian_politics_event.2.o2: "The Underdogs Of The East Shall Guide Us To Solidarity"
cascadian_politics_event.2.o3: "Our Nation Is Ours To Guide And Grow"
cascadian_politics_event.2.o4: "Our Nation Is Ours To Assert And Expand!"
cascadian_politics_event.100.t: "Western Influences Grow"
cascadian_politics_event.100.d: "In the past couple of weeks it appears more western principles and practices seem to have won over more and more of the voting population. As we get into the finish stages, it's now up to the main parties that have grown from this movement to try and seize the initiative. The CCP, NCP, LPC and SPP certainly do have their work cut out for them."

cascadian_politics_event.101.t: "The Final Four"
cascadian_politics_event.101.d: "As votes are beginning to be cast and tallied up it now comes down to a final four. The tight race boils down between the pro-business party known as the Cascadian Consumer Party, the center-right New Conservatives Party, the center-left Liberal Party of Cascadia and finally the progressive movement that is the Social Progress Party. These four will soon be reduced to one winner or some general coalition if things don't prove to be clear enough."

cascadian_politics_event.200.t: "Eastern Values Grow"
cascadian_politics_event.200.d: "The autocratic and socialistic values of those in the east and far east like Russia, China and Central Asia to name a few are becoming more popular. The interesting dynamic overall seems to be a collective growth, but also a growing split between socialist and autocrats. This dynamic will likely split the vote but in the end the direction of the nation seems to need a more egalitarian or more iron willed approach going forward. I just hope it's the best choice we could've made."
cascadian_politics_event.200.o1: "Uh...Are We Sure About This?"
cascadian_politics_event.201.t: "Autocracy vs Communism"
cascadian_politics_event.201.d: "As the votes begin to be tallied up the growing divide between these last handful of parties is becoming wider and wider. Soon we'll know just what direction our nation will be taking. The current divide is between the parties of Autocratic primacy which include the Party for Greater Cascadia as well as the Conservatives for Cascadia. On the other side we have in the communist corner it is the Red Mountain Party and the Peoples Party of Cascadia. From this we shall set the stage for a future to take hold and set a precedent for years to come."

cascadian_politics_event.300.t: "Lord More Choices"
cascadian_politics_event.300.d: "Things continue forwards as votes are beginning to be cast and more voters continue to consolidate around a more domestic focused set of parties. With no inate outside and or foreign influences being exerted on our young nation, it seems the people have turned to an interesing mix of left and right oriented political parties. But it's still to early to start picking out a winner and or \"winners\"."

cascadian_politics_event.301.d: "Things are nearing their conclusion and as such it's down to the people themselves to determine the course for which our young nation will take. From this either then GCP, BBP, CLP or RPC will end up taking the victory outright or if no one can secure a majority then they'll need to work together in a coalition and set a precedent for years and potentially decades to come of political cohesion and actions."

cascadian_politics_event.400.t: "Nationalist Ferver Grips The Nation"
cascadian_politics_event.400.d: "As things continue to play out more and more voters are turning towards more nationalistic stylized parties. These parties are a range of right wing with some being a bit more unsavory to the more moderate voting citizen. However it'll take time to figure out what materializes from this growth in nationalism."

cascadian_politics_event.401.t: "Just How Bitter Are We?"
cascadian_politics_event.401.d: "Things continue to heat up as a battle for first place is fought over a varied amount of interestingly different parties. Ironically in the most moderate of the freaky four as nihlist have begun to call the main choices to come out, we have the House of Olympia a monarchist party apart of the New Wave Movement. This party is looking to make an Elective Monarchy with a constitution as the legal binding authority. While many are skeptical of this sort of \"fairy tale\" platform, others seem to be a bit more taken by the reapproachment of old ideas with new ideals. Up next we have the Strength & Unity Party, a sort of typical right wing populist oriented party, some jokely call it the Cascadia First Party given the platforms flexible but pro-Cascadia leaning choices overall. Following them we have the political wing of what seems to be the Cascadian Military, this party seems to be more economically flexible, but looks to be more socially conservative with things being more militarized in nature. While some don't care for the proposed mandatory service period, the cohesive programs to be \"ready for any\" is also pretty inviting. Finally we have the fairly frowned upon Scarlet Brigade, a movement and or political party oriented around the metric of, lets take what the S&UP are doing and lets turn that up to like a 10 and some since those guys are pretty weak on the \"real\" issues. Regardless we'll have to wait for the votes to be tallied to be sure just who will be victorious."
