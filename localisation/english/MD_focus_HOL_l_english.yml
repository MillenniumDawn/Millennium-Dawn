This rejection poses a significant setback to the Netherlands' vision of a more interconnected Europe. With Germany’s refusal, the future of the Wunderline hangs in the balance.

This decision forces the Netherlands to reconsider its strategy. With the German rejection, the options now include continuing the development of the HSL-Oost within Dutch borders, potentially extending only to Arnhem, or scrapping the project altogether.

 HOL.Provincial_Railways.305.d: "Although Germany has declined to participate, Belgium has expressed its willingness to move forward with the Three-Country Route project. This partial agreement leaves the Netherlands with a challenging decision: whether to proceed with the project alongside Belgium, albeit on a reduced scale, or to reconsider the entire plan. The absence of Germany complicates the project but does not diminish its potential impact on regional connectivity. The Netherlands must now weigh the benefits of collaboration with Belgium against the challenges of proceeding without full international support."

 HOL.Provincial_Railways.306.d: "In a disappointing turn of events, both Belgium and Germany have rejected the proposal for the Three-Country Route, effectively halting the Netherlands' vision of a comprehensive cross-border rail network. This rejection is a significant setback, forcing the Netherlands to reevaluate its transportation strategy. With the original plan no longer viable, the focus must shift to alternative options, such as improving existing routes within Dutch borders or reallocating resources to other national projects. The outcome highlights the challenges of international cooperation and the complexities of regional infrastructure development."
