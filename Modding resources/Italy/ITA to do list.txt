TO DO LIST

STUFF TO FIX
-rewrite stuff using arrays
-set up starting coalition (january 2000)

MAJOR MECHANICS
-Member of Parliament mechanic with actual chambers n shit for a better representation of government crisis
(freboot eurpean parliament UI) (or gui if that is done in the future)

-remove policies from focus tree and at the same time flesh out more the choice to get a party in power in the focus tree 
(political campaigns in the democratic branch, coups, revolts, foreign interference whatever in the non democratic)
instead move policy to scripted gui / ui / decision category ui where it as to allow greater flexibility in handling them
(example cherry picking policies to keep when changing a government through policy change)
of course introduce mutually exclusive check in the system to prevent opposite policies to be active at the same time

-military focus rework
-european-wide projects for military vehicles and ships (optional)(will need papinian help for that probably)

MAFIA
-Adapt focus tree cost to regional mafia strength instead of using the average for all mafia branches
-adapt police effectivness to be based around mafia strength in the corresponding region instead of the median value of all clans
-make a meme tree where mafia takes over the country (super low priority)
-pictures for the scripted mafia gui (low priority)
-balance numbers to have mafia stay between 0.4 and 0.7 if no focuses are taken
-move basic anti mafia decisions to events
 (Instead of 1 event per region every 3 months make 1 small and 1 medium event per region each year and 1 big every some years)
- increase the pool of events for every region (instead of calabria being always drugs, sicily being always migrants ecc)
- custom icons for events if possible

PARTIES
-new policies about social issues in the sub ideology branches
-Write descriptions for parties and add party logos
-Move M5S to emerging socialist, lega nord to non aligned conservative, lega salvini to emerging reactionaries, alleanza nazionale to nat populism
-Branches for emerging socialist+non aligned communist and lega nord+lega salvini+alleanza nazionale
-Move totalitarian communists to non democratic branch
-Make a military coup path as precursor to current non democratic branch, with option to keep coup in power as nat autocracy

FOCUS TREE
-give filters to the new focuses
-custom icons for focuses and ideas (can't do it myself, need a graphic wizard)
-expand the "italian federation" and "dismantle the nation" sub-branches
-make a small tree for the new nations if italy splits (distant future)
-a focus tree branch about the relation with the church
-a focus tree branch about the absolute trainwreck that is Rome and its administration
-develop the fight against tax evasion and anti corruption measures with a slightly more complex mechanic instead of just a single focus
-add more interactions with Internal factions all around

RANDOM STUFF
