 chi_mars.1.d: "Our scientists and engineers are ready to send our Rover to the mars. It has a total sum of roughly 14 sensors installed, along with tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment. This Rover will need to be regularly moved as the Mars day lasts 1 1/5 Earth days, which is far too long for batteries to keep stored power on the Mars.\n\nThe Rover itself will be on the poles, easily moveable, to get the maximum usage of our solar panels. Additionally, experiments will be carried out to determine long-term living conditions on the Mars. Extraction of ice could not only lead to liquid water for plants and food for future astronauts on the Mars, but also lead to separating it into oxygen and hydrogen, rocket fuel.\n\nThis may take months or years to get the research needed to do this. Within this time, however, using the funds for this project, we will build a depot orbiting the Mars to allow easier access to the Mars, and refueling to get to Earth.\n\nAll of this is achievable within the next decade. Now, however, is the time to launch."

 chi_mars.2.t: "Mars Colony Project"
 chi_mars.2.d: "If humans want to colonize Mars, they must establish a permanent base that is self-sustaining. This is the dream of countless space explorers and the only way for humans to set foot in the space. All this will become a reality today."
 chi_mars.2.o1: "Mars here we come!"
 chi_mars.3.t: "Landing System failure"
 chi_mars.3.d: "After a journey of nearly 60 million kilometers, our spacecraft finally appeared over Mars. The iron oxide all over Mars showed a red appearance. The planet, long visible only through a lens, is now within sight. \n\"The spacecraft enters landing mode.\" The captain, who had practiced countless times on the simulator, issued the order, but there seemed to be a problem with the landing device. At this time, large beads of sweat instantly covered the captain's forehead."
 chi_mars.3.o1: "Taiyuan, we've had a problem."
 chi_mars.4.t: "Vehicle Failure"
 chi_mars.4.d: "After a thrilling half hour, the spacecraft finally escaped the risk of crashing and landed crookedly on the Mars Utopia Plain. This is also the landing site of the previous Zhurong rover. It is recognized as the largest impact basin on Mars and the solar system, with an estimated diameter of 3,300 kilometers. \nAfter landing, the crew will transfer to a special rover and head to the southern part of the plain to establish a base, but the vibrations from the previous landing of the spacecraft seem to have had some impact on the rover. It is clear that situation has developed not necessarily to crew's advantage"
 chi_mars.4.o1: "There seems to be something wrong with our bloody vehicle today."
 chi_mars.5.t: "Arrival at Base"
 chi_mars.5.d: "40 kilometers, the first time humans have traveled such a long march on a planet other than Earth. Such an ordinary distance on earth is a breakthrough in the history of human spaceflight. \nAfter going through the tense process of setting up camp, transmitting all necessary data back to the earth, and checking the parameters of all equipment, the captain who was sitting on the bed could finally take a drink of water. \nThrough the window of transparent synthetic material above the head, a light point among the stars shone with a little blue light, and that was the Earth. \n\n'Better.' the captain muttered."

 chi_mars.7.t: "Arrival at Base"
 chi_mars.7.d: "The landing point of the spacecraft was the preset address of the base, and the crew began to camp on the spot to prepare for the construction of mankind's first permanent base on Mars. No one noticed that the space boots left countless messy footprints on the Martian soil."
 chi_mars.7.o1: "One small step for Mars, one giant leap for mankind."
 chi_mars.8.t: "Locate Water Source"
 chi_mars.8.d: "Water is an essential resource for human survival. One of the main purposes of previous Mars exploration activities was to find water sources on Mars. Although there are no surface lakes or rivers like Earth, Mars' water resources basically exist in the form of ice under the surface of Mars. \nHowever, the actual precise positioning requires someone to conduct on-site surveys in person."
 chi_mars.8.o1: "Paper will sleep shallow, never know the matter want to practice. "
 chi_mars.9.t: "Underground Radiation Protection"
 chi_mars.9.d: "Due to the thin atmosphere of Mars and the lack of a planetary magnetic field, radiation from space reaches the surface unimpeded. The base could not provide enough shelter when it was first built, so digging a nest in the ground became the first choice to avoid radiation. \nWitnessing the operation of the excavator's long arm, the crew remembered the past when the Republic built the first oil base in the Songnen Plain."
 chi_mars.9.o1: "Just like days in Daqing"
 chi_mars.10.t: "The First Harvest on Mars"
 chi_mars.10.d: "The problem of water sources has been solved, and the energy source is temporarily provided by solar power. Therefore, the production of food on Mars has become the most important matter at present. \nTraditional cereal crops have been excluded due to their growth cycles and harvesting processes, and potatoes have become the first human crops to be grown on Mars. Although Mars is not as bright as Earth due to the distance from the sun, the potatoes in the greenhouse seem to grow more lushly. Humanity's first harvest on Mars is in sight."
 chi_mars.10.o1: "All nature, organic, Martian-grown potatoes."
 chi_mars.11.t: "Sandstorm"
 chi_mars.11.d: "Sandstorm are a common occurrence on Mars. Although the air pressure on Mars is much lower than that of the Earth, the Martian storm is not as devastating as the previous legends, just like in that movie. \nHowever, the raised dust still poses a lot of hidden dangers to human bases, especially since solar energy is an indispensable energy source for current bases."
 chi_mars.11.o1: "We have no chance to save Matt Damon here."
 chi_mars.12.t: "Accident"
 chi_mars.12.d: "To go up the mountain often and eventually run into a tiger. The Martian dust storm lasted far longer than previously expected, and the battery life inside the base seemed to be in a very pessimistic situation. \nIn order to continue the Mars colony mission, we need to make a decision, choose to evacuate and find a new location, or continue to repair the damaged facilities."
 chi_mars.12.o1: "Evacuate"
 chi_mars.12.o2: "Fix Base"
 chi_mars.13.t: "Evacuate"
 chi_mars.13.d: "We can't wait any longer. The situation is now very critical and it's time to use backup rockets for evacuation. After checking that all the team members had safely boarded the ship, the captain reluctantly looked back at the base building that was still in building. He suppressed the grief in his heart and gave the order to the artificial intelligence guide to launch the spacecraft. \n'We will be back!' As a huge burst of smoke rose, the spacecraft broke away from the Martian ground and slowly rose into the sky."
 chi_mars.13.o1: "Where there is life, there is hope."
 chi_mars.14.t: "Repair Damaged Base"
 chi_mars.14.d: "We cannot sit back and wait, we must start repairs on the base immediately with any cost, otherwise all the gains we have made on Mars will be ruined, and no one can survive in this chaos. Saving the base means saving ourselves."
 chi_mars.14.o1: "For the sake of sacrifice and great ambition, we dare to make a new world."
 chi_mars.15.t: "Mars City Project"
 chi_mars.15.d: "We have made outstanding achievements in building a Mars colony. But there is still some distance to go before we can finally achieve our goal. Do we still want to continue investing in Mars construction?"
 chi_mars.15.o1: "Upgrade"
 chi_mars.15.o2: "Don´t need it"
 chi_mars.16.t: "Yes"
 chi_mars.16.d: "As long as we take one more step forward, our mission on Mars will be completely completed. There is no half-measures in our agenda."
 chi_mars.16.o1: "Don't pass the responsibility to the next generation."
 chi_mars.17.t: "No"
 chi_mars.17.d: "The current Mars base is complete enough, and it is unwise to continue to invest more. We still have many problems to face on earth, and it is impossible to just throw money into space."
 chi_mars.17.o1: "Believe in the wisdom of future generations."
 chi_mars.18.t: "Mars City completed"
 chi_mars.18.d: "After our unremitting efforts, our colony on Mars has finally been completed. Human beings will never forget these efforts, and one day human beings will set foot on the entire galaxy."
 chi_mars.18.o1: "Our journey is the whole galaxy."
 chi_mars.19.t: "Established New Sub-base"
 chi_mars.19.d: "As more spacecraft brought more personnel and materials, the originally Mars base began to prosper. The water resources under the original base can no longer carry more people, and it is urgent to establish a new sub-base. \nAs the spacecraft of the first team gradually disappeared from sight, the former captain and today the mayor of first new Beijing city recalled the past when the Mars rover fell into a trench."
 chi_mars.19.o1: "Mom, I’m going on a long voyage today."
 chi_mars.20.t: "Mars City Monument"
 chi_mars.20.d: "As humans have traveled across Mars, Mars has become the new home for humans on Earth. The terraforming of Mars is proceeding in an orderly manner. At the first landing point of the human spacecraft, a huge monument was built to commemorate the men and women who sacrificed their lives during the journey and construction in the process of conquering Mars. They will forever be engraved in the journey of human civilization."

A total sum of roughly 12 astronauts will be sent there, along with tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment, supplies, living spaces, and personal items. This outpost will need to be regularly moved as the Lunar day lasts 29 Earth days, which is far too long for batteries to keep stored power on the Moon.\n\nThe base itself will be on the poles, easily moveable, to get the maximum usage of our solar panels.

 chi_moon.1.o1: "Launch!"
 chi_moon.2.t: "Moonbase Alpha"
 chi_moon.2.d: "Our scientists and engineers have officially landed on the Moon, and are currently in the process of setting up the Moon-base. Each section is divided into \"modules,\" not quite buildings on their own, but not together as one. There is a habitation module, for rest, food module, for growing food, lab module, which is the largest with most of the scientific equipment, a maintenance module, containing all the maintenance tools to repair things if they get broken, an amenities module, since these people are here for 6 months, and working all day everyday isn't good for the mind, and quite a few solar panels.\n\nFood deliveries will be common for these first months as it takes time to grow food. Water and oxygen will be obtained through the Lunar ice. Lastly, these scientists will stay until shortly after moving to the next location in roughly 6 months time when the solar panels become defunct due to the Lunar day and night where the outpost is located lasts 6 months.\n\nMoonbase Alpha is complete."
 chi_moon.2.o1: "Science!"
 chi_moon.3.t: "Colony Progresses"
 chi_moon.3.d: "Our scientific outpost on the Moon has had a major breakthrough. With expansion of their current solar panel network, and recent discoveries making separating water to make oxygen and hydrogen easier, they have been able to come up with enough oxygen and hydrogen to fully fuel the most recent supply rocket. This is such a necessary breakthrough which will allow the Moon itself, given enough time and investment, can become a hub for future space ventures into outer space.\n\nSpace itself is getting smaller."
 chi_moon.3.o1: "We're good at being pioneers"
 chi_moon.4.t: "Crisis on the Moon"
 chi_moon.4.d: "Drastic measures need to be taken place immediately. For reasons currently unknown, the habitation module has ruptured and \"exploded.\"\n\nAn hour ago, all 12 scientists were doing their duties when, all of a sudden, there was a massive rupture in the habitation module.\n\nSince waves don't travel in a vacuum, most didn't realize until they physically saw what had happened.\n\nThere is an emergency fund as part of the budget, so there is no need to allocate more funds to the project, and the scientists can always sleep in the other isolated modules; however, this has spooked many, stating that a few, many, or even all of our scientists could have died, and has also lowered the morale of the scientists since they could have died. Thus, attempting to continue the outpost on the Moon will be politically costly, and a rotation of scientists may need to happen now rather than later, due to the sapping of morale.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 chi_moon.4.o1: "Send emergency aid!"
 chi_moon.4.o2: "Abandon the project. It's not meant for us"
 chi_moon.5.t: "Colony Progresses Further"
 chi_moon.5.d: "Our Moon outpost has made another major breakthrough. They have managed to ship Hydrogen 3, a gas which seems perfect for fusion, to Earth, and scientists at home have figured out how to conduct fusion with it! Not only this, but the power generated from this fusion is near the amount used to do the reaction in the first place. This means that, with some improvements, this could result in successful fusion power! Not only does this allow immense benefits at home, along with knowledge we may be able to use in using other materials for fusion, we can use this on the Moon, allowing a permanent outpost rather than mobile outposts!\n\nAll of this is far ahead of schedule, which is a surprise, and many at CNSA have been left unprepared to implement this into the current Moonbase. So, a new Moonbase is needed, in a much better spot for rapid expansion than the current location of Moonbase Alpha. It's time to start preparations on Moonbase Beta."
 chi_moon.5.o1: "Life continues on"
 chi_moon.6.t: "Another Crisis on the Moon"
 chi_moon.6.d: "More drastic measures need to be taken now. Two more modules have ruptured. This time, it's both the Food and Amenities modules.\n\nRoughly forty minutes ago, a scientist was about to enter the Food module when it suddenly exploded. The scientist is fine, and no-one but the plants were harmed. However, it was adjacent to the Amenities module, and it caused it to rupture and explode. Again, no-one was hurt.\n\nThis new occurrence, however, has raised the hairs of many back home, questioning the safety of the modules. After the previous explosion, CNSA replaced the modules, ensuring that they wouldn't explode, but it seems like prolonged pressure can cause something to break much more easily than it would otherwise. CNSA has already quickly responded, ordering new modules be made immediately, as well as a close inspection of all current modules (As you can't \"recall\" modules from the Moon as of this moment).\n\nWith mounting pressure at home to stop going forward with the project until all safety concerns are resolved, the continuation of the Moonbase program comes into question. In addition to the political pushback, the emergency fund has been cut in half, so CNSA is requesting another $5 billion to sort out future concerns. It remains your choice to decide whether to continue."
 chi_moon.6.o1: "Send more emergency aid!"
 chi_moon.6.o2: "We can't continue doing things like this"
 chi_moon.7.t: "Moonbase Beta"
 chi_moon.7.d: "At this point, our scientists and engineers on the Moon need to move to another location on the poles. The costs for doing this are already established in the long-term budget, so we don't need to add any new funding to the project yet.\n\nWith this new moonbase, we will be able to use new discoveries we have uncovered to allow the base to be established permanently, unlike our previous moonbase. With the use of better rockets, better power generation, better ice extraction and separation, we can use this new base, at a site more suited for rapid expansion, to facilitate colonization efforts of the Moon. This is not the only good news, entrepreneurs and corporations are flooding to CNSA en-mass for requests to put their newly developed mining systems on the Moon. Even other space programs in other countries are now extremely interested in starting up scientific and mining outposts on the Moon, however, due to your diligent efforts, we not only have a massive head start, but we are the only country actively attempting to colonize the Moon.\n\nThe future on our Moon is bright and Chinese."

 CHI_Flowing_Spring_desc: "Taking his Chinese Dream to the next level, Xi Jinping has drawn on a poem from the 8th century BCE entitled \"Flowing Spring\" which concerns regaining greatness and prosperity.

 CHI_War_on_Crime_desc: "During his time as Party secretary of Chongqing, Bo Xilai made fighting organized crime one of his top priorities.

 CHI_Scrap_Military_Commands: "Scrap Military Commands"
 CHI_Scrap_Military_Commands_desc: "The PLA's seven military commands are overly cumbersome and would hinder the ability of different units to coordinate in the event of a large-scale conflict.

However, this change will not come without consequences, as many military officers will resist this disruption."
 CHI_Cut_Ground_Troop_Numbers: "Cut Ground Troop Numbers"
 CHI_Cut_Ground_Troop_Numbers_desc: "Quantity is not an issue for the PLA, but quality is. Moreover, the PLA Ground Forces dwarf the other arms of the military, meaning we are burdened with an overly landlocked, cumbersome force.

 CHI_Stamp_Out_Corruption: "Stamp Out Corruption"
 CHI_Stamp_Out_Corruption_desc: "One of the biggest hurdles to making the PLA a modern military on par with those of the West is corruption. We should use the Central Military Commission to crackdown on any signs of corruption that we can find."

 CHI_Question_the_Four_Cardinal_Principles_desc: "Deng Xiaoping's Four Cardinal Principles included upholding the socialist path, the people's democratic dictatorship, the leadership of the CPC and Maozedong thought.

 CHI_Unchain_the_8_Democratic_Parties_desc: "While the Communist Party dominates Chinese politics, 8 other legal parties exist as part of the country's political system.

 CHI_Return_of_the_Dalai_Lama_desc: "Tibet has been a source of great concern for our regime in the past few decades. While we have historically dealt with the issue by means of censorship and repression, it may be better for our authority in the province if we were seen to grant concessions to the Tibetan people.

 CHI_Two_Systems_desc: "While most of China can still conform to our existing form of governance, we should keep to Deng Xiaoping's \"One Country Two Systems\" principle and allow certain parts of China to maintain their own unique political, economic, and legal systems.

 CHI_The_NPCSC_Decision_on_Hong_Kong_desc: "China's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has a decision to make regarding the extent of electoral reform we can grant Hong Kong.

 CHI_Hong_Kong_Future: "Hong Kong's Future"
 CHI_Hong_Kong_Future_desc: "We have so far made no indication as to the fate of Hong Kong when the Basic Law preserving its current autonomy expires in 2047. It may be in our interest to do so now as promising a continuation of Hong Kong's autonomy could help convince Taiwan to return to our control.

 CHI_Greater_Tibetan_Autonomy_desc: "Tibet is a region with a unique cultural and religious identity. While we must continue to regard it as an integral part of the Chinese nation, it may serve our purposes to grant a greater degree of self-rule to the Tibetans than they currently possess."

 CHI_Drop_Opposition_to_Taiwanese_Independence_desc: "While in the past we have expressed an intent to prevent Taiwanese independence at all costs, we must now come to realize that belligerence towards Taiwan may suit our purposes less than a more pragmatic approach.

 CHI_Mediate_Korean_Peace_Talks_desc: "For too long the Korean peninsula has existed in a frozen state of war. Tensions between North and South Korea exist due to mutual suspicion and distrust over defensive actions that are misconstrued as offensive ones.

 CHI_Annex_Bhutan: "Annex Bhutan"
 CHI_Annex_Bhutan_desc: "Our claims over Bhutan may not extend over the country's entire territory, but the country's close historical ties to Tibet should provide reasonable justification for our desire to integrate Bhutan into the Tibet Autonomous Region.
