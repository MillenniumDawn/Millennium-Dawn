EVT_19001_DESC;Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba's economy was left paralyzed. To counter this the Castro regime opened the country to tourism, leading to increased income. As a result of this, the use of U.S. dollars was legalized in 1994. Two separate economies were created in the country, one dollar-economy and one peso-economy, with the dollar economy making much more money and thus creating social differences on the island.

EVT_94501_NAME;Shutting down the Ergneti market;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_94501_DESC;When Mikheil Saakashvili was elected President in 2003, he made his goals clear to return the two breakaway regions of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, under central control.

In retaliation, South Ossetian forces closed the highway between Russia and Georgia for several days. Georgia began to restore the roads and dispatched military patrols to control them.

In accordance with our agreements with NATO we will sell all types of submarines and a number of smaller surface combatants, but the question remains what to do with our 4 old missile frigates - 'Kotor', 'Novi Sad', 'Podgorica' and 'Beograd'. 'Beograd' and 'Podgorica' are way too old and should be scrapped, but if we intend to maintain a combat-capable navy we should consider keeping and refitting 'Kotor' and 'Novi Sad'.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

EVT_31019_DESC;Today the contract for the construcion of the North European Gas Pipeline, a natural gas pipeline leading through the Baltic Sea directly from Russia to Germany, will be concluded. The project is not without environmental and political impact: Eastern European states are likely to be bitter about the loss of significant transit revenues as well as a loss of political influence.

EVT_31026_DESC;The Turkish Prime Minister himself visited the site of the fire disaster and held a speech for the large Turkish minority in Germany, in which he requested moderation and calmness from them. While this may have calmed the tides, it is nonetheless a very bad sign for Germany's minority integration policy.

A foreign youth was killed today in a brawl by a 3 year older German. Reportedly, the Moroccan and a friend had attempted a robbery and were stabbed by their victim in self-defense after a violent fist fight. The foreign minority is outraged about what they see as xenophobic injustice, since no charges are being pressed against the German, while the surviving would-be robber faces trial.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

EVT_31032_DESC;The controversial Hartz reforms were an essential part of Chancellor Schröder's Agenda 2010-concept aimed at modernizing Germany's labor market, reducing unemployment and stimulating economic growth. Today the Bundestag has to vote on Hartz IV, which will combine the former unemployment benefits with regular welfare benefits, in the process greatly reducing the payments for long term unemployed to the lower welfare level and shortening the time of full unemployment pay by up to 2 years.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31033_NAME;Hartz III;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31033_DESC;The controversial Hartz reforms were an essential part of Chancellor Schröder's Agenda 2010-concept aimed at modernizing Germany's labor market, reducing unemployment and stimulating economic growth. Hartz III profoundly restructured and reformed the Federal Labor Institution which had proven to be ineffective and overly bureaucratic. While Germany badly needed these reforms, the population is openly hostile against the changes, since many of them reduce social transfer payments.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31034_NAME;Hartz IV;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31034_DESC;The controversial Hartz reforms were an essential part of Chancellor Schröder's Agenda 2010-concept aimed at modernizing Germany's labor market, reducing unemployment and stimulating economic growth. Hartz IV significantly reduced the time of unemployment payment and forced long-term unemployed to take the much lower welfare benefits. While Germany badly needed these reforms, the population is openly hostile against the changes, since many of them reduce social transfer payments.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31035_NAME;Monday demonstrations against Hartz IV;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31035_DESC;Today organised demonstrations against the abhorred Hartz IV reforms erupted in the streets. While only 10.000 people, most of them long term unemployed, took part, this is a bad sign. Hartz IV will provide significant cutbacks in social welfare benefits and the assorted laws are already vehemently despised, even though they haven't taken effect yet. It is very likely that the opposition against the reforms will only grow as the date of their entry into force draws nearer.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31036_NAME;Demonstrations against Hartz IV reforms continue;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVT_31036_DESC;In only two weeks, over 100.000 people began to regularly march in protest of the Hartz IV-reforms, congregating in over 100 German cities and towns, mostly in East Germany, which suffered the most under the conditions of rising unemployment levels. The demonstrations were arranged and named Monday demonstrations in an analogy to the 1989/1990 Monday demonstrations which brought down the regime of East Germany, despite some weak criticism over the political abuse of this name.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31037_NAME;Demonstrations against Hartz IV reforms continue;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVT_31037_DESC;As the government didn't intend to give in to the demands of its people, the Monday demonstrations continued to grow. On August 30th, already well over 200,000 people participated in the protests, loudly singing "Wir sind das Volk!" (we are the people!) and other slogans previously used against the East German communist regime. The right wing extremists and predominantly the Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany tried to use all this to their advantage, voicing radical opinions to a huge audience.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31038_NAME;Demonstrations against Hartz IV reforms continue;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVT_31038_DESC;In September, nationwide approximately 11 percent of all people in working age took part in the Hartz IV-protests, peaking with about 18 percent participation in East Germany, closely mirroring the level of unemployment in most regions. While the demonstrations have been entirely peaceful so far, radical groups like the Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany and the German Pact parties steadily increase their influence on the organisation of the demonstrations.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31039_NAME;Demonstrations against Hartz IV reforms continue;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVT_31039_DESC;In September, nationwide approximately 11 percent of all people in working age took part in the Hartz IV-protests, peaking with about 18 percent participation in East Germany, closely mirroring the level of unemployment in most regions. While the demonstrations have been entirely peaceful so far, radical groups like the Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany and the German Pact parties steadily increase their influence on the organisation of the demonstrations.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31040_NAME;Demostrations decline;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVT_31040_DESC;Finally, in the middle of October, the Monday demonstrations began to die down significantly. Disheartened by the lack of response from the government, many people gave up their resistance against the inevitable and started to view the reforms as a necessary evil which would hopefully at least improve the situation at the labor market. Nevertheless, over the next few years limited Monday demonstrations continued to be held irregularly in some cities.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31041_NAME;2005 Black February;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31041_DESC;This year, February has proven to be an especially bleak month for the German labor market. A whole series of announcements of outright layoffs, downsizings and location closures from many major corporations, but especially the sudden bancruptcy of the Walter Bau AG, shocked the population. All in all, even though many firms, like the Deutsche Bank for example, made record profits, 100.000 jobs were to be lost during the year counting only the official notifications made in February alone.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31042_NAME;Unemployment figure passes 5 million!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31042_DESC;For the first time since the Second World War, the unemployment figure in Germany has reached and passed the psychologically important number of 5 million. While some point to the changes made to the statistic by the Hartz reforms as a major source of the increase, others complain that now even more people are omitted from the data than before. Politicians everywhere are on the search for a solution or at least an easy scapegoat that can be blamed for the catastrophic figures.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31043_NAME;German national rail strike;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVT_31043_DESC;Breaking away from the collective labor agreement signed by the other unions in June, the tiny GDL demanded a 31 percent wage increase from the state-owned Deutsche Bahn AG. It argued that German locomotive engineers were paid far less than their counterparts in other European countries. As expected, their bold wage demand was rejected despite the danger that the union may paralyze the rail system with a strike. Government intervention may be the only option to bring them back to the negotiation table.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31044_NAME;Abuse of visa distribution in German ambassies;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31044_DESC;As the German public now slowly begins to realize, the buildings of several German ambassies are flooded with visa-applicants and have, in fact, been so for quite some time. Alone the German ambassy in Kiev, Ukraine, is believed to have issued nearly one million supposedly valid visas in the last 4 years. Even worse, Ukrainian security personell apparantly demands up to 250 Euro for the right of entry. It is unclear to this hour whether the Foreign Ministry is even investigating the case.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31045_NAME;Government accused of allowing human trafficking;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31045_DESC;In a ruling against a criminal accused of people smuggling, the district court of Cologne surprisingly critizised government officials: Because of serious misjudgement, the Foreign Ministry had made the crimes possible in the first place. The so-called Volmer Decree of Secretary of State Volmer allegdedly would tear wide holes into existing immigration laws, making criminal exploits laughably easy. Additionally the court complained that its work had been deliberately hindered by the government.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31046_NAME;Visa-affair: Opposition demands creation of an inquiry comission;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31046_DESC;Despite some rhetorical attacks in the Bundestag on the Foreign Ministry and especially State Secretary Volmer, most politicians kept surprisingly quiet about what the media soon began calling the Visa Affair. As the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein drew nearer, however, the opposition decided to finally capitalize on the scandal and demanded the creation of an official inquiry commission tasked with investigating the suspicious circumstances in Germany's visa policy.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31047_NAME;Volmer Decree finally withdrawn;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31047_DESC;After Germany's visa policy had increasingly come under attack over the course of the year, starting with media reports about its obvious abuse in February and the demand for an inquiry comission in summer, finally in October State Secretary Volmer decided that perhaps it would be a good idea to withdraw the controversial decree bearing his name, which had ordered the ambassies to drop overly bureaucratic visa procedures in favor of a quick distribution for tourists.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31048_NAME;Visa-affair: First sitting of inquiry comission;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31048_DESC;Headed by Eckart von Klaeden, the comission today had its first sitting. So far links to no less than three important government politicians have been found: Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer and his Secretary of State Ludger Volmer as well as Minister of the Interior Otto Schily apparantly knew about problems with the Volmer decree as early as of the year 2000. It has now become a hot topic between opposition and government whether their questioning should be made public or kept confidential.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31049_NAME;Interrogation of ministers will be broadcasted life on TV;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31049_DESC;For the first time in the history of the German Bundestag, the sittings of an inquiry comission were made avaiable to the media. This measure gave both sides the opportunity to win over public opinion in order to end the affair in their favor. It now remained to be seen whether the opposition would manage to crush the accused under the weight of the evidence or if the ministers, some of them very charismatic orators, would be capable of talking their way out of the scandal.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31050_NAME;Interrogation of ministers behind closed doors;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31050_DESC;With the decision to keep the interrogations private, both sides could hope to resolve the affair through power politics. Since the speaking time was assigned according to the seats in the Bundestag, the government could build on wasting much of the interrogation-time. On the other hand, the opposition didn't have to hold back during questioning for there was no danger of angering the public through hostile attitude or unfair procedures.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31051_NAME;Minister of State Ludger Volmer linked to corruption;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31051_DESC;After the investigations into the visa affair had already rooted out some corrupt ambassy employees - predominantly in Kiev and Tirana - who had used the ill-worded Volmer decree for personal gains, finally in February it became known that Secretary of State Volmer himself had also personally cashed in on the distribution abuse. Apparantly he had received unexplained payments from the Federal Print Office which in turn had profited from the increased demand for German visas and travel passes.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31052_NAME;Interrogation of former Minister of State Volmer;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31052_DESC;Ludger Volmer tried to shift most of the responsibility on older edicts signed under the CDU/FDP-government of Helmut Kohl in the '90s. In his view, these older parts, which had been integrated into the Volmer decree, were the ones which were the most open to abuse. Additionally, he challenged the opinion that the decree had even increased criminal offenses, since human trafficking would have taken place anyway. All in all, he valued the increased freedom to travel over the damage done.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31053_NAME;Interrogation of Foreign Minister Fischer;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31053_DESC;At the beginning of the affair, Fischer had been the most popular politician in Germany by a wide margin  -as usual for the prestigious office of Foreign Minister. He mostly supported Volmer's viewpoint and accused the opposition of using abominable exaggeration and propaganda, but also admitted to have made some misjudgements during the affair. Alone his introductionary speech lasted 2 hours and 18 minutes. At the end of the day, nobody was exactly sure who had really won the interrrogation.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31054_NAME;Interrogation of Foreign Minister Fischer;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31054_DESC;At the beginning of the affair, Fischer had been the most popular politician in Germany by a wide margin  -as usual for the prestigious office of Foreign Minister. He mostly supported Volmer's viewpoint, but also had to admit to have made several serious misjudgements. On one side he answered many questions with detailed knowledge, but nevertheless denied to remember several key particulars. In the end it seemed to be certain that he was more involved in the affair than he wanted to admit.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31055_NAME;Government tries to stop comission;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31055_DESC;On June 2nd, the Red/Green majority in the comission ended the hearing of evidence, claiming lack of time till the early federal elections as their procedural reason. According to law, an inquiry comission is required to work out a concluding report if it gets apparant that it won't be capable of finishing its task before the end of the legislative period. Predictably, the oppostion CDU and FDP appealed to the Federal Constitutional Court, since they suspected policial motives behind the move.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31056_NAME;Interrogation of Minister of the Interior Schily;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31056_DESC;In a display of rhetorical mastery unheard of in the anals of skillful play for time, Otto Schily managed to draw out his introductionary defense speech to no less than 5 hours and 16 minutes, very likely making it the longest political speech the public was ever forced to listen to, albeit more than one comission member fell asleep sometime after the first break. Even though the sitting lasted after midnight, little time remained for the CDU to try to make their charges stick to the minister.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31057_NAME;Interrogation of Minister of the Interior Schily;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31057_DESC;Minister of the Interior Otto Schily had received much time to prepare himself for the interrogation, but the opposition nevertheless hoped to be able to tarnish his reputation. As early as of the year 2000, Schily had complained in a letter to the Foreign Minister that the Volmer decree was in conflict with German and European law and that he hadn't been consulted in its creation. After a discussion with Joscka Fischer, however, Schily mysteriously dropped his resistance against the decree.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31058_NAME;Visa-affair: Inquiry Comission ends work;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31058_DESC;After the President of Germany had officially dissolved the Bundestag, the inquiry comission was required to end its task even without having reached a definite conclusion. While the opposition was quite content with the results of the questionings, which had seriously harmed the reputation of some of the most important politicians in Gerhard Schröder's cabinet, the sudden end nevertheless left many questions unanswered. Many fishy circumstances and involvements would remain a mystery forever.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31059_NAME;Visa-affair: Inquiry Comission ends work;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31059_DESC;Finally, the comission looking into the visa affair and the related cases of corruption or plain failure within the Foreign Ministry and other government departments published its concluding report. In it, many politicians, among them Joschka Fischer and Otto Schily, were found to be guilty of allowing easy human trafficking into Germany's borders and preventing a timely response against criminal activity either through inaction or even through obstruction of other state authorities.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31060_NAME;Laurenz Meyer steps down over RWE-affair;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31060_DESC;General Secretary of the CDU Meyer had to admit today that he had obtained power from his former employer RWE AG at a discounted employee rate even though he quit in 1999. After this became known, new allegations surfaced, according to which he was also receiving payments from RWE. Additionally he was still getting earnings as deputy speaker in the North Rhine-Westphalian state parliament and was thus receiving no less than three salaries at once, earning him the nickname Gluttonous Laurenz.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31061_NAME;Corruption affair in Federal Labor Institution;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31061_DESC;Florian Gerster, head of the Federal Labor Institution, is accused of being involved into several cases of cryonism and the following cover-up attempts after they were discovered. Apparantly, under his reign many profitable public relation contracts were handed out without offering the required tendering procedure for competitors. While Gerster hasn't made the best press so far, he nevertheless is responsible for the skilled, efficient and quick modernisation of the gargantuan Institute.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31062_NAME;The el-Masri case: abductee tries to sue the CIA;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31062_DESC;According to his own statement, the Lebanon-born German citizen Khaled el-Masri had been abducted by the CIA during a visit to Macedonia, after which he was transported to Afghanistan, where he was interrogated, tortured and even raped under suspicion of having contact to islamists. When his German passport was confirmed to be genuine and it became clear that he had been confused with an al-Qaeda member of the same name, he was abandoned naked in an Albanian wood without explanation.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31063_NAME;Reports about secret CIA prison camps in Europe;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVT_31063_DESC;Reports about the brutal methods of the American secret service in its anti-terror-campaign have sparked outrage in the media this week. Allegedly the CIA is maintaining secret prison camps in Eastern Europe, occupied by abducted terror-suspects from all over the world. The public is especially enraged over the fact that the CIA apparantly uses German airports and bases to transport its victims. So far, US officials only declared that the prisoners aren't brought there to be tortured.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31064_NAME;Government ministers under fire over CIA-affair;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31064_DESC;In relation to the allegations against the CIA, which is accused of abducting German citizens and maintaining secret prison camps in Eastern Europe, government officials of the former Red/Green government have come under attack. The general charge is that they knew about these illegal operations and approved of them. In at least one known case Germany even actively participated in the interrogation of abducted terror-suspects, as in the case of Mohammed Zammar who had been imprisoned in Syria.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31065_NAME;CIA-affair: Government briefs parliamentary control comittee;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVT_31065_DESC;In light of the recent media accusations about the involvement of German ministers in outrageous and illegal CIA activities, the Chancellor needed to act. It was decided to inform the parliamentary control comittee about BND-activities during the war on terror and the invasion of Iraq. After several secret meetings, the comittee came to the conclusion that all questions had been answered to their satisfaction. Still, opposition delegates in the Bundestag demanded a more open debate.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31066_NAME;CIA-affair: Opposition protests against information blockade;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVT_31066_DESC;After the Chancellor had decided to withhold the information from the public, the opposition decided to pursue the establishment of an inquiry comission, which would have to be created if one quarter of the Bundestag delegates demanded it. It is expected that the comission will have to interrogate Gerhard Schröder, Joschka Fischer and Frank W. Steinmeier, the Chancellor, Foreign Minister and chief of the Chancellor's office at that time, who are all presumed to be involved into the affair.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31067_NAME;CIA-affair: Bundestag debate about secret service activities;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31067_DESC;After the different parties had been informed about the extent of the knowledge of the former Red/Green coalition about the activities of the CIA and the abduction of German citizens, the opposition accused some of the former government officials of failing in their responsibility to protect the terror-suspects. Despite the political opposition of Germany against the USA following the invasion of Iraq, the ministries apparantly had cooperated happily with the US in its illegal avtivities.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31068_NAME;CIA-affair: First sitting of inquiry comission;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31068_DESC;Today the first sitting of the BND-inquriy comission took place, which will be looking into the circumstances of the abduction of Khaled el Masri by the CIA and the interrogations of terror-suspects in Guantánamo and Damascus by German agents. The comission will concern itself predominantly with the question whether the ministers of the SPD/Green government neglected the protection of civil liberties in favor of appeasing the USA.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31069_NAME;CIA-affair: BND-members admit unauthorized activities;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31069_DESC;The comission looking into the affair managed to turn up two serious offenses within the German secret service BND. Evidently a German agent in Macedonia had been informed about the abduction of el Masri from day one on, even though the BND had denied to have known about it until his release five months later. Even worse, in another investigation evidence was turned up that proved that two German agents in Bagdhad had relayed coordinates to American forces during the invasion of Iraq.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31070_NAME;CIA-affair: inquiry comission drags on without definite results;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31070_DESC;Since both the current federal government as well as the former ministers and BND-members kept most of their knowledge secret and cooperation with US authorities couldn't be achieved, the entire inquiry soon began to stare into space. Even though investigations carried on well into 2009, no result of note was ever produced.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31071_NAME;Former Chancellor Schröder accused of cronyism;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31071_DESC;A controversy has erupted over Schröder's blatant abuse of his friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which earned him a job in the comittee for the North Stream Pipeline Company, a 6 billion dollar undertaking  - which he had rubber-stamped only weeks before leaving office. The media is accusing him of cronyism and conflict of interest. As Chancellor, he imposed drastic cuts in the welfare state, now, he has gone on to a lucrative management post without blinking an eye.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31072_NAME;BND approached with illegal offer;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31072_DESC;The BND has been approached with an unsusual offer: In exchange for 4.2 million Euro and the inclusion into our witness protection program, a former computer technician of the LGT Bank in the uncooperative tax heaven of Liechtenstein is prepared to hand over a CD with highly explosive content: incriminating bank information about thousands of costumers. The data might be sufficient to convict hundreds of citizens of channeling money into the LGT bank for the purpose of tax evasion.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31073_NAME;CD acquired;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31073_DESC;After handing over the demanded sum to the informant, the BND as promised got hold of the CD with the incriminating data, which was handed over to the tax investigation office in Wuppertal. Furthermore, the secret service entered negotiations with several other western governments which also enjoyed the chance to lay hands on some of their tax fraudsters. While the entire matter has been handled absolutely descreetely so far, the coming year will bring some promising revelations.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31074_NAME;Liechtenstein tax affair: police raids office of Deutsche Post AG's chief executive;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVT_31074_DESC;Today the police conducted a raid against Klaus Zumwinkel, the chief executive of Deutsche Post AG, under the suspicion that he evaded about 1 million Euro in taxes. Pressured by the government, he soon resigned from his position. Similairly, a number of other individuals have been under investigation for months, and the appearance that the state is acting against the well-to-do has given us a boost in public opinion. The German elite always was under suspicion of abusing tax laws.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31075_NAME;Liechtenstein tax affair: further tax dodgers convicted;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31075_DESC;Since February 18th a number of raids have been conducted in Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt and other cities. All in all, about 600 to 700 suspects are involved in the affair. Several banks were searched, including Dresdner Bank, UBS, Bankhaus Metzler and the Hauck & Aufhäuser bank. In the meantime, revenue offices also noted a much higher number of voluntary self-incriminations for tax evasion by people with financial assets in Liechtenstein - this move will avoid or reduce punitive damages.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31076_NAME;UNICEF-scandal: Wastage of donation money;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31076_DESC;Executive director Garlich of UNICEF Germany is accused of wasting donations by paying excessive fees for external contractors. The district court of Cologne is now investigating against him under the suspicion of breach of trust. Because of the affair and other problems in the management, Garlich had been in a bitter conflict with the president of Germany's UNICEF branch, Heide Simonis, for months. The entire management resigned today to allow a new beginning after the loss of many donators.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31077_NAME;Eavesdropping controversy at Deutsche Telekom;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31077_DESC;It became public today that the prosecution office in Bonn is investigating against members of Deutsche Telekom's advisory and executive boards, suspected of ordering illegal eavesdropping against journalists and members of the supervisory executive board of their company. Allegedly initiated by then chairman Zumwinkel and CEO Ricke, the objecitve of the illegal activities was to root out board members who had repeatedly leaked confidential information about planned mass-layoffs and acquisitions to the media in 2005 and 2006.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31078_NAME;Nazis in Bundeswehr;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31078_DESC;As the ministry of defense confirmed, a NPD-plot to use our armed forces for propaganda means has been uncovered. Since the Bundeswehr's formation, it has stood under intense but sadly fruitless scrutiny to prevent its infiltration by nazi sympathizers. Due to a video tape sent in anonymously, a ring of right wing extremists has been discovered and was subsequantially expelled. Lawyers now filed a constitutional complaint to force us to revoke the dismissals of some of the participants on the grounds of insufficient evidence.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31079_NAME;KSK-commander Günzel under fire for endorsement of antisemitic politician;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31079_DESC;A normally renowned leadership figure, Günzel this week spectacularly stumbled over his open and hearty endorsement of an antisemitic speech of a controversial CDU politician held earlier this month. To make matters worse, the leader of the KSK special forces expressed his risky opinion in a letter using the official Bundeswehr notepaper, giving his outburst a seemingly official touch. Following this derailment, a quick and equally spectacular discharge of the commander certainly would be the easiest solution.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31080_NAME;Bundeswehr scandal: Group of drunk recruits hunts down foreigners;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31080_DESC;In what could become the largest scandal for the Bundeswehr in this decade, a group of six drunken Bundeswehr recruits on leave in the town of Detmold in North-Rhine Westphalia have hunted down and seriously injured 9 foreign-looking victims. Apparantly agitated after an earlier argument with a gang of turkish youths, the six conscripts were instigated to their hunt by another recruit known to have contact to extremist circles. All persons involved are now under investigation for being nazi sympathizers.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31081_NAME;Spiegel article unveils dramatic right wing extremist infiltration of Bundeswehr;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31081_DESC;The Spiegel weekly magazine, which has a long track record of uncovering political misconduct and creating scandals, issued a lenthy article this week which aims at revealing just how much the Bundeswehr is being infiltrated by nazi-sympathizers. Admittedly, it's an open secret that our armed forces are regarded as an excellent recruiting ground by right wing movements. Partly, this is to be expected, since the military appeals to conservative-leaning youths, but on the other hand it is also the result of the Bundeswehr being born as the child of and last area of retreat for former nazi officers. Sadly, this development has lead to many of our elite formations becoming pillars of the right wing extremist movement, as the Spiegel forcefully demonstrates in its article.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31082_NAME;Afghanistan skull photo scandal;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31082_DESC;Photos of German soldiers posing with skulls in Afghanistan have provoked media outrage this week. The scandalous photos threaten to plunge the Bundeswehr into its biggest crisis in years. This desecration of the dead flies in the face of the whole concept of our mission to win the hearts and minds of the population in Afghanistan. We have promised tough disciplinary actions.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31271_NAME;Violation of 2+4 Agreement;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31271_DESC;As several advisors were quick to point out, the current military expansion started by our government unfortunately is in violation of the Two Plus Four Agreement negotiated between the two German republics and the four occupying powers during the reunification of Germany in 1990. In exchange for receiving back full souvereignity over our territory, our predecessors agreed to limit the size of our combined armed forces to no more than 370,000 personnel and furthermore reaffirmed our renunciation of the manufacture, possession of and control over nuclear weapons. Sadly, the new army research and production priorities are in violation of this agreement. We should change our course before it is too late.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31272_NAME;Violation of 2+4 Agreement;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31272_DESC;Since we failed to undo the conditions that led to our violation of the agreement, the international community now regards us to be in open violation of the Two Plus Four Agreement. In our role as the scapegoats of two world wars, we probably should have known better than hoping to be able to downplay the significance of our army enlargement initiative, even though our attempts to protect our own nation in these troublesome times are hardly unjustified. The international community sadly isn't very likely to forget this affair anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31273_NAME;Germany in open violation of Two Plus Four Agreement!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31273_DESC;Since Germany failed to undo the conditions that led to its violation of the 2+4 Agreement, in which it agreed to limit the size of its combined armed forces to no more than 370,000 personnel and furthermore reaffirmed its renunciation of the manufacture, possession of and control over nuclear weapons, we must now regard them to be in open violation of international law. As the culprits of both world wars, the Germans probably should have known better than hoping to be able to downplay the significance of their army-enlargement campaign. The international community expects us to act in the light of this provocation or we will lose face! Luckily, the world-wide opinion is overwhelmingly on our side and Germany will likely remain without any support whatsoever in this affair.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

EVT_31297_NAME;Spannungsfall: State of Tension;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31297_DESC;In Germany, the Spannungsfall (state of tension) is the constitutional term for the precursor of the Verteidigungsfall (state of defense) and was originally intended to mobilize the Federal Republic for an impending war against the Warsaw Pact in its role as a frontline nation. In the light of the recent crisis, the Bundestag has congregated today in an emergency sitting to vote on the issue whether the current crisis is serious enough to satisfy the requirements. Should the motion pass the parliament, many crucial responsibilities will be transferred from the state governments to the federal government. Furthermore, the Bundeswehr will be allowed to deploy its forces within Germany and make them combat-ready.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31298_NAME;Verteidigungsfall: State of Defense;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVT_31298_DESC;As the crisis escalated, the German government saw no other way to respond to the threat than to suggest the declaration of the Verteidigungsfall (state of defense). This constitutional procedure, created during the height of the Cold War, places the Bundeswehr under the direct control of the Chancellor. The Gemeinsamer Ausschuss (Joint Comittee), a board of 48 parliamentarians, will carry on the duties of the Bundestag and Bundesrat, which are to be suspended along with all elections for the duration of the crisis. These measures are intended to ensure the government's capacity to act and maintain its control over the nation in these difficult times. Let's hope that for once we'll be fighting on the winning side of a war.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

EVT_31301_DESC;Edmund Stoiber, ambitious minister-president of Bavaria and slated minister for economics in the new conservative cabinet, is campaigning for an extension of his ministerial duties. Wolfgang Clement, his precursor, headed a combination of the ministries of labour and economics and was sometimes referred to as a super-minister for his supremely influential position. Even though this post was split up again after the election, Stoiber now desires to obtain a similairly important position.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31302_NAME;Stoiber withdraws from Berlin;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31302_DESC;After the Chancellor had to personally intervene to stop the power-struggle within the coalition, Stoiber's hopes of achieving a super-ministry were ruined. The former Chancellor-candidate of the year 2002 was now reduced to be one minister among many. Needless to say, he soon announced his decision to return as minister-president to his home-state Bavaria. This proved to be the end of his political career, as he later stumbled over a party-internal spying affair and was abandoned by his own party.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

EVT_31303_DESC;Today the grief-stricken nation recieved news that former president Johannes Rau has died. Rau, who had been plagued with ill health for several years, was held to be one of Germany's great moral authorities and known for his unusually direct speeches and fair criticism of all parties. As SPD-minister-president of North-Rhine-Westphalia, he was responsible for some of the best-ever election results for his party. A devout christian, his motto was to reconcile, not divide.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

EVT_31304_DESC;Franz Müntefering, party chairman of the SPD and famous for his locust-attacks on international investors, today announced his resignation from all official government posts. Allegedly he wants to spend time with his wife, who has been diagnosed with cancer.

The nation whishes him farewell.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

EVT_31305_DESC;As a SPD spokesman acknowledged today, Matthias Platzeck, minister-president of Brandenburg and party chairman of the SPD since Müntefering's resignation, withdraws from his position as chairman after having been admitted to hospital three times during the last two months, suffering from two severe hearing losses and a mental and circulatory collapse, very probably due to extreme stress.

EVT_31309_NAME;Jürgen Möllemann dies in accident;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_31309_DESC;FDP-politician Jürgen Möllemann today died in a skydiving accident under suspicious circumstances, likely suicide. A passionate liberal, he had been vice-Chancellor in the cabinet of Helmut Kohl, but resigned in 1993 over the Briefbogen-affair: he had stupidly used an official letterhead for advertising a relative's business idea. Shortly before his death, Möllemann's parliamentary immunity had been lifted over allegiations that he was involved in illegal arms deals and tax-evation.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

EVT_31311_DESC;After already suffering from two heart attacks and one stroke, the former minister of defense and SPD faction leader in the Bundestag, Peter Struck, announced that he intended to end his political career while he still had the time.

EVT_31312_DESC;Otto Schily, one of the founding members of the Green Party, now an influential SPD member and former Minister of the Interior, announced today his decision to retreat from politics. Over the course of his long and eventful career, which also saw him entangled in several illegal affairs, Schily always valued his own moral princples over party politics, which led first to his estrangement from the increasingly fundamentalist Greens and his later fall-out with the radical left wing of the SPD.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

Its military intervened and stopped the Georgian offensive aimed to take back the renegade republic of South Ossetia. Although the whole international community, with the exception of Russia, doesn't recognize the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, there are some within our government who believe we should recognize the two entities. This would of course damage our relations with the US but strengthening of relations with Russia, in the wake of its return to the world stage as a global power, could prove to be highly beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

EVT_89501_DESC;In early and mid-2003, Súmate, a grassroots volunteer civilian voter rights organization, began the process of collecting the millions of signatures needed to activate the presidential recall provision provided for in Chávez's 1999 Constitution. In August 2003, around 3.2 million signatures were presented, but these were rejected by the pro-Chávez majority in the Consejo Nacional Electoral on the grounds that many had been collected before the mid-point of Chávez's presidential term.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

EVT_89502_DESC;In November 2003, the opposition collected an entirely new set of signatures, with 3.6 million names produced over a span of four days. Riots erupted nationwide as allegations of fraud were made by Chávez against the signature collectors. Finally, after opposition leaders submitted to the CNE a valid petition with 2,436,830 signatures that requested a presidential recall referendum, a recall referendum was announced on June 8, 2004 by the CNE. Chávez and his political allies responded to this by mobilizing supporters to encourage rejection of the recall with a 'no' vote.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

EVT_89503_DESC;On May 9, 2004, a group of 126 Colombians were captured during a raid of a farm near Caracas.

This plan soon became unnecessary, as an initial engagement of armored units south of the city saw most of the Republican Guard's assets destroyed and routes in the southern outskirts of the city occupied. Initially, the U.S. Army's Third Infantry Division executed a raid to test remaining Iraqi defenses, with 29 tanks and 14 AFVs advancing to the Baghdad airport. They met heavy resistance, but were successful in reaching the airport. The next day, another brigade of the 3rd I.D. attacked into downtown Baghdad and occupied one of the palaces of Saddam Hussein in fierce fighting. US Marines also faced heavy shelling from Iraqi artillery as they attempted to cross a river bridge. The Iraqis managed to inflict heavy casualties on the American forces near the airport from defensive positions but suffered severe casualties from air bombardment. Despite these losses, Iraqi casualties were also high.

EVT_68502_NAME;Situation in Transnistria;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_68502_DESC;Transnistria, also known as Trans-Dniester, Transdniestria, and Pridnestrovie is a disputed region in the southeastern Europe. Since its declaration of independence in 1990, followed by the War of Transnistria in 1992, it is governed by the unrecognized Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, which claims the left bank of the river Dniester and the city of Bendery within the former Moldavian SSR. The modern Republic of Moldova does not recognize the secession and considers PMR-controlled territories to be a part of Moldova's sovereign territory. After the dissolution of the USSR, Transnistria declared independence leading to a war with Moldova that started in March 1992 and was concluded by the ceasefire of July 1992. Although the ceasefire has held, the territory's political status remains unresolved: De jure part of Moldova, Transnistria is a de facto independent. After the recent Russian intervention in Ukraine many fear that the next target for Russia will be Moldova, and with it, Romania. Subsequently, support for a reunification of Romania and Moldova has risen considerably. Hawkish circles within our government propose, claiming covert support from the United States, that we annex Moldova and Transnistria with it.

EVT_37055_NAME;Alliance with India;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_37055_DESC;China and India have fought a brief war in 1962, and since then we have been rivals competing for strategic influence in Asia. However recently our relations have been steadily improving, especially since India joined the SCO as an observer. In our current situation we could use this to our advantage and gain an important ally in Asia. Our advisors suggest that we initiate secret negotiations with them about a potential alliance against the USA.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_37056_NAME;China offers an alliance;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVT_37056_DESC;China has approached us by using secret channels through their embassy in Delhi. The offer was quite dazzling to our officials - they offer us a military alliance against the USA. In the present situation that would effectively mean war between India and the USA and the urgency of the request suggests the Chinese are in search for every ally they can get. The rapid developments so far make it probable that we will have to make our decision quickly in the following days.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_37057_NAME;Chinese-Indian negotiations;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_37057_DESC;Urgent news from our intelligence agencies: it seems that China has approached India by using secret channels through their embassy in Delhi. It is not difficult to conclude that the offer is about a military alliance against us. The urgency of the request suggests the Chinese are in search for every ally they can get, and rapid developments so far make it probable that India will have to make its decision quickly in the following days. Therefore the Joint Chiefs have begun preparations for war against India.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_37058_NAME;India at the crossroads;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_37058_DESC;The time has come to make our decision. War with the USA would be the biggest challenge India has faced since achieving independence, but victory would bring an enormous boost to India's position in the world and perhaps rank us as one of the top superpowers.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

EVT_38101_DESC;Saudi Arabia is ruled by an authoritarian regime of the Saudi dynasty, which is loyal to the USA.

EVT_18751_NAME;Independent Croatia?;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_18751_DESC;The Balkans is secured and under our control. So far Serbia has appeared as our only ally in this region, but the situation changed recently when our intelligence made contact with various Croatian marginal nationalist politicians who desire their independence restored. Their condition is that we reshuffle the map and divide Bosnia-Herzegovina between Croatia and Serbia. An independent Croatia as an ally would benefit us, however we might loose our position in Serbia if we force them to abandon their newly-gained territories.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_18752_NAME;Russia demands a map reshuffle;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVT_18752_DESC;Russian foreign minister has approached with a request to accept a new partition of West Balkans. Under the terms of the new agreement we would have to abandon Croatian-dominated territories and Croatia would be given independence. We would gain Russia's favor if we accept, but an independent Croatia, enlarged by parts of Bosnia, could in the future grow into a dangerous strategic adversary.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
EVT_18753_NAME;Serbia agrees;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

EVT_19291_DESC;Cuba has a very good geostrategic location. It is close to the United States of America and its naval and air bases could be upgraded to host Russian aircraft and naval vessels. This would be particularly useful now that we're at war with the Americans, however such an adventure would surely draw Cuba into the war. Our military experts propose that we offer Cuba an alliance in exchange for military and economic help, along with other potential benefits should the Western powers be defeated.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
