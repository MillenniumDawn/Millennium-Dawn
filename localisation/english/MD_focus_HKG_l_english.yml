 Basic_Law_milltary_HKG: "The Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR"
 Basic_Law_milltary_HKG_desc: ""
 Basic_Law_HKG_desc: "The Basic Law was the founding document of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after the handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China. Among other things, the document outlines the status of Hong Kong relative to China, granted it autonomy in all matters other than defence and foreign affairs, both of which are entrusted to the central government.\n\n§W----------\nAs a §Y[HKG.GetFlag]§!§HS.A.R§!, does not have its own defense force, the Required level of defense budget will be maintained at §H0§!, and would also not allow to change §GMilitary Speeding.§!§!"
 One_Country_Two_Systems: "One Country Two Systems"
 One_Country_Two_Systems_desc: "§Y[HKG.GetFlag]Hong Kong§! and §Y[MAC.GetFlag]Macau§! has been guaranteed 50 years of autonomy from direct Chinese rule. The model of one country two systems allows for a preservation and indeed growth of many of Hong Kong and Macau's treasured political freedoms, such as freedom of speech and freedom of public assembly. The absence of these rights in the mainland is a significant driver behind support for the \"pan-democrat\" camp in Hong Kong politics, with many concerned Hongkongers remaining wary of greater integration with mainland China."
 HKG_triads_dynamic_modifier: "The Triads"
 HKG_triads_dynamic_modifier_desc: "When the communists took power in China huge numbers of triad members fled to the British territory of Hong Kong for safety. In the following decades powerful triads such as the Wo Shing Wo, Sun Yee On and 14K triads have run protection rackets, gambling dens and other illicit activities. Despite their anti-communist roots, the triads have also started supporting Chinese interests in Hong Kong due to business connections on the mainland."
 Localist_Movement: "Localist Movement"
 Localist_Movement_desc: "Ever since the handover in 1997, tensions between mainland Chinese and Hongkongers have led to the development of localist \"Hong Kong First\" sentiment amongst some local Hongkongers. This sentiment views communist China's political system with distrust, but also views Hong Kong people as culturally distinct and indeed superior compared to the people of China. The rise of this movement from the 2014 Umbrella Movement onward has changed the previously more measured tone of the Hong Kong political divide into one that is more emotive and radical."
 Lacks_Universal_Suffrage: "Lacks Universal Suffrage"
 Lacks_Universal_Suffrage_desc: "While the Basic Law calls for the Chief Executive and Legislative Council to eventually be elected by universal suffrage, this eventuality has yet to come to pass primarily due to China's concerns about what may happen if the significantly more popular pan-democrats take control of the government."
 Limited_Universal_Suffrage: "Limited Universal Suffrage"
 Limited_Universal_Suffrage_desc: "China has agreed to allow the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to be elected by universal suffrage, on the condition that candidates must be vetted by China first. This is widely seen as a move to reduce the likelihood of pan-democrat or localist candidates becoming Chief Executive."
 Universal_Suffrage: "Universal Suffrage"
 Universal_Suffrage_desc: "China has finally agreed to permit Hong Kong to elect its Chief Executive by way of universal suffrage without interference by the Chinese authorities."
 Hong_Kong_Protests: "Hong Kong Protests"
 Hong_Kong_Protests_desc: "Following recent actions by the Chinese government, widespread protests have broken out in Hong Kong demanding a reversal of the Chinese move."
