# Spirits
 TAJ_national_guard_deployed: "Tajik National Guard"
 TAJ_national_guard_deployed_desc: "The state has decided that Islamist political activity must be dealt with. We are using the National Guard to ensure that they slowly fall apart and retreat to their homes.\n§W------------------§!\nWhile this national spirit is active, £TAJ_kingdom  §HIRP Influence§! will be reduced by §G-1%§! every month."
 TAJ_military_infancy: "Military Infancy"
 TAJ_military_infancy_desc: "Unlike other post-Soviet states, [TAJ.GetFlag] Tajikistan did not build it's army from Soviet Units stationed within the nation. Rather, [TAJ.GetFlag] Tajikistan chose to build an army from scratch, disbanding all units that weren't made by the state. This has led to an in-experienced army that has not fought in a major conflict outside of an internal one.\n§W------------------§!\nThis national spirit can be §RRemoved§! if we go down the '§HArmed Forces of Tajikistan§!' branch in the §HFocus Tree§!."
 TAJ_flight_of_labor: "Flight of Labor"
 TAJ_flight_of_labor_desc: "Economic instability has led to 50% of the male population immigrating to countries such as [SOV.GetFlag] [SOV.GetName] just to find work. While this practice could benefit individual families, the [TAJ.GetFlag] Tajik economy ultimately hurts the most as a result of a lack of skilled labor. Furthermore, some men abroad begin attending foreign mosques and are more prone to islamic extremism, leading to occasional incidents.\n§W------------------§!\nThis national spirit will be §RRemoved§! if our §HGDP/c§! exceeds §H$10B§!.\n§W------------------§!\nRemoval of this national spirit will allow us to end the §HEchoes of the Ummah§! and the £TAJ_kingdom  §HIRP Influence§! campaigns."
 TAJ_woes_of_the_civilwar: "Woes of the Civil War"

Opposition groups to the central government unified under the UTO (Unitied Tajik Opposition), with some secession movements arising in the [BDA.GetFlag] Badakhshan region. Once the Civil War was concluded, the £TAJ_emerging_reactionary  People's Democratic Party signed a treaty with multiple groups from the UTO, such as the £TAJ_kingdom  Islamic Renaissance Party and the £TAJ_western_conservative Democratic Party of Tajikistan, granting some concessions in exchange for a ceasefire.\n§W------------------§!\nThis national spirit will be §RRemoved§! if we change §HCountry Outlook§!, or we conclude the [BDA.GetFlag] §HBadakhshan Conflict§!."
 TAJ_201st_base: "201st Military Base"
 TAJ_201st_base_desc: "The 201st Military Base has been critical in our nations short history thus far, as the base serves as a hub of [SOV.GetFlag] Russian influence, and protection even though we do not border them.

 TAJ_radicalism_system: "Echoes of the Ummah"
 TAJ_radicalism_system_desc: "\n£TAJ_desctext_irp\n\n\n\nPoverty, corruption, nepotism and unemployment are amongst the grievances our people have held against our government. However, one stands above them all and is the final straw for many. Our suppression of Islamic practices have led some of our people to believe that religion is the answer to the problems within \n§H[TAJ.GetFlag] Tajikistan§!, and strongly believe a new state must emerge from our land. Some join groups such as the £TAJ_kingdom  §HIslamic Renaissance Party§!, and despite not being an active insurgency, occasional strings of attacks may appear randomly linked to the organization. Economic factors such as low GDP, or unemployment, make people more likely to leave the nation and potentially become radicalized. Certain political actions such as secularization may increase £TAJ_kingdom  §HIRP Influence§!. If at any point £TAJ_kingdom  §HIRP Influence§! reaches 100%, movements will appear that will attempt to destabilize us, the region and our close partners.\n\nCurrent £TAJ_kingdom  §HIRP§! Influence: [?TAJ_radical_influence]%"
 TAJ_deploy_national_guard: "Deploy the National Guard"
