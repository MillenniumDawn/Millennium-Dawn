### Drafting Stage
- [ ] Focus tree is layed out in software (Diagram.net e.g.), it is better to think what focuses will do while making a markup as well
  - Example: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TRd4JlJOCefTLHUeeuZ2jR4ZIQP3s2CT/view
- [ ] Detailed notes for the tree is not required but it is preferred.
  - Example: [MD Malta Content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fJkTQ5reL2Ie7ZmvlKSR7gusdK4ZPy1DepZiBVaMTzs/edit#heading=h.ygnfuf8mihof)
- [ ] Draft is approved by mentor/lead developer

**DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL THIS STEP IS COMPLETED**

- [ ] Ensure the error.log is completely clear of anything relevant to your content
- [ ] Complete at least one singular playtest before presenting it to the playtesters
- [ ] Run a performance check on your content
- [ ] Draft is reported as done to lead dev and confirmed to be ready for testing
- [ ] Verify all effects match up with the standards in [MD Code Resource](https://gitlab.com/Millennium_Dawn/Millennium_Dawn/-/wikis/Home/MD-Code-Resource)

### Playtest Phase
- [ ] Tester task is written and provided to the playtesters
- [ ] Once you have received results implement fixes/improvements to be made


### Completion Stage
- [ ] Changelog.txt and Authors.txt are updated
- [ ] Merge request is created, comments are fixed
- [ ] Other localisation teams are notified about incoming content
- [ ] Request is merged, job is done, git branch deleted and discord channel archived
