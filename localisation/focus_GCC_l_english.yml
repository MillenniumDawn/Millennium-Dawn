 GCC_socio_economic_affairs:0 "Socio-Economic Affairs"
 GCC_socio_economic_affairs_desc:0 "The economy and society of [ROOT.GetNameDef] yield interesting challenges. Many argue that our current dependence on oil is unsustainable and outsiders have criticized our policies towards foreign migrants. Moreover, voices from both within and without are clamoring for improvements in the rights of women."
 GCC_the_rentier_state:0 "The Rentier State"
 GCC_the_rentier_state_desc:0 "The [ROOT.GetAdjective] economy is commonly characterized as that of a rentier state. This is due to how our income is derived from external oil "rents". This income is then distributed to our subjects in the form of subsidies and welfare, allowing our country to function without a tax system or representative government. However, it is a well-known fact that one day the oil that this system depends upon will run out."
 GCC_expand_oil_extraction:0 "Expand Oil Extraction"
 GCC_expand_oil_extraction_desc:0 "While the need to diversify our economy is clear, that does not mean that we need to put an immediate stop to our oil extraction activities."
 GCC_joint_ventures:0 "Joint Ventures"
 GCC_joint_ventures_desc:0 "While [fossil_fuel_industry_name] is perfectly capable of carrying out its oil extraction activities on its own, it could still benefit from the resources and technological knowhow of other oil firms."
 GCC_total_sa:0 "Total S.A."
 GCC_total_sa_desc:0 "Total is a French oil and gas company and one of the seven "Supermajor" oil companies."
 GCC_royal_dutch_shell:0 "Royal Dutch Shell"
 GCC_royal_dutch_shell_desc:0 "Shell is an Ango-Dutch firm and the third-largest company in the world. Its resources and expertise accumulated over more than a century could be a great asset for [fossil_fuel_industry_name]."
 GCC_lukoil:0 "Lukoil"
 GCC_lukoil_desc:0 "The Russian energy giant Lukoil may not have the long history of some of its European competitors, but it has nonetheless grown rapidly to become one of the world's largest oil producers."
 GCC_sinopec:0 "Sinopec"
 GCC_sinopec_desc:0 "The China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation or Sinopec is the world's largest oil refining, gas and petrochemical conglomerate and can therefore draw upon immense financial resources."
 GCC_stock_market_listing:0 "Stock Market Listing"
 GCC_stock_market_listing_desc:0 "An initial public offering (IPO) of [fossil_fuel_industry_name] will in many ways act as a litmus test of our country's stability. If domestic and international investors have confidence in our country the IPO will be a success, but it may also fail to raise substantial sums of money. The amount of money raised by our IPO will determine how much we can contribute to our sovereign wealth fund."
 GCC_sovereign_wealth_fund:0 "Sovereign Wealth Fund"
 GCC_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc:0 "The windfall from the IPO can bolster our sovereign wealth fund, improving our ability to make investments abroad as well as to finance public services and infrastructure projects at home."
 GCC_secure_the_fossil_fuel_industry:0 "Secure the Fossil Fuel Industry"
 GCC_secure_the_fossil_fuel_industry_desc:0 "State control over [fossil_fuel_industry_name] has served us well in the past and shall continue to do so. Even without direct ownership over the company, our government can keep [fossil_fuel_industry_name] on a tight leash and prevent it from becoming too autonomous."
 GCC_untether_the_fossil_fuel_industry:0 "Untether the Fossil Fuel Industry"
 GCC_untether_the_fossil_fuel_industry_desc:0 "For decades we have maintained tight control over [fossil_fuel_industry_name], but with the IPO the time has come to relinquish our iron grip. Such a move will undoubtedly anger those who currently benefit from state control and will allow an independent power base to form in the company's leadership. However relinquishing control will allow the company to more effeciently carry out its activities."
 GCC_innovative_techniques:0 "Innovative Techniques"
 GCC_innovative_techniques_desc:0 "The 21st century brings new challenges and new opportunities. We must use these opportunities to develop new and intelligent ways to overcome the challenges involved in oil extraction."
 GCC_deepen_the_safety_net:0 "Deepen the Safety Net"
 GCC_deepen_the_safety_net_desc:0 "Our system of rule relies on the distribution of wealth to our citizens through public services. We can put our oil revenues towards an expansion of this system of patronage. This will shore up support for our government."
 GCC_subsidize_economic_activity:0 "Subsidize Economic Activity"
 GCC_subsidize_economic_activity_desc:0 "Subsidies for the business activities of our merchant class is another major avenue of patronage provision which our authority depends on. Not only will increasing subsidies with our oil revenues shore up the merchant class's support for our government, but it will also help stimulate the [ROOT.GetAdjective] economy."
 GCC_reinforce_patronage_networks:0 "Reinforce Patronage Networks"
 GCC_reinforce_patronage_networks_desc:0 "While our subjects and the merchant class are important sources of support for our government, there are other political forces whose loyalty is even more crucial to our government's survival. We should reinforce the patronage networks that guarantee the loyalty of these political actors."
 GCC_invest_in_the_metal_industry:0 "Invest in the Metal Industry"
 GCC_invest_in_the_metal_industry_desc:0 "While our country is most known for the extraction and export of fossil fuels, God has also gifted our country with light metals. While focusing on the extraction of these raw materials will do little to diversify our economy, it will provide useful short-term benefits."
 GCC_diversify_the_economy:0 "Diversify the Economy"
 GCC_diversify_the_economy_desc:0 "In order to reduce our reliance on oil we should invest in other sectors of the economy particular the secondary and tertiary sectors relating to manufacturing and services. This will be no easy task and will inevitably encounter opposition from those who benefit from the status quo."
 GCC_shrink_the_safety_net:0 "Shrink the Safety Net"
 GCC_shrink_the_safety_net_desc:0 "Our current provision of social services is important to our government's legitimacy but is bloated and unsustainable. We must make necessary cuts in order to further the diversification of our economy."
 GCC_private_sector_job_creation:0 "Private Sector Job Creation"
 GCC_private_sector_job_creation_desc:0 "Our government has historically employed the majority of citizens in the public sector. While this has ensured stable employment for the people of [ROOT.GetNameDef], it is not a state of affairs that is conducive to a dynamic and diversified economy. We should open up space within the private sector for former public sector employees but this will naturally involve a shrinking of the public sector."
 GCC_construction_boom:0 "Construction Boom"
 GCC_construction_boom_desc:0 "Investing in construction is essential to achieving a diversified economy."
 GCC_support_the_aviation_sector:0 "Support the Aviation Sector"
 GCC_support_the_aviation_sector_desc:0 "Airlines from Etihad to Qatar Airways have bolstered the international image of their home countries and are unique enterprises in otherwise oil-dominated economies. We should support our domestic aviation industry to capitalize on this reputation and increase our progress towards diversification."
 GCC_support_the_entertainment_industry:0 "Support the Entertainment Industry"
 GCC_support_the_entertainment_industry_desc:0 "Film and music are areas in which our country is decidedly lacking. Supporting these sectors of the economy will not only develop useful economic opportunities but will also increase our government's support among the wider population. However, this policy's contradiction with fundamentalist Islamic values may make us enemies in some quarters."
 GCC_support_manufacturing:0 "Support Manufacturing"
 GCC_support_manufacturing_desc:0 "Because of our country's vast natural resources, [ROOT.GetNameDef] has never fully industrialized. In addition to developing the service sector, we should also support our budding manufacturing industry."
 GCC_the_dubai_model:0 "The Dubai Model"
 GCC_the_dubai_model_desc:0 "Dubai has developed a unique economic model by the standards of the Gulf, one that has successfully reduced the Emirate's reliance on oil. However, this model of encouraging foreign investment and tourism has come at a cost, with many residents of Dubai feeling disenchanted with Westernization and uneven economic growth. Pursuing this model may be a pathway to diversification for [ROOT.GetNameDef], but it will be resisted."
 GCC_reduce_vice_prevention:0 "Reduce Vice Prevention"
 GCC_reduce_vice_prevention_desc:0 "In order to attract foreigners to our country we must first relax some of our more austere laws, particularly those regarding the prohibition of alcohol and restrictions on clothing. However, these actions will not be without consequences."
 GCC_court_tourism_and_foreign_businesses:0 "Court Tourism and Foreign Businesses"
 GCC_court_tourism_and_foreign_businesses_desc:0 "Now that we have sufficiently relaxed our social laws, we have paved the way for foreign investment to support our domestic infrastructure and for the tourism sector to act as an alternative to oil."
 GCC_end_the_rentier_state:0 "End the Rentier State"
 GCC_end_the_rentier_state_desc:0 "The rentier state depends upon a constant stream of oil revenue. Given that this is no longer possible, it is high time that we put an end to the rentier state and find alternative sources of legitimacy."
 GCC_end_oil_dependency:0 "End Oil Dependency"
 GCC_end_oil_dependency_desc:0 "Our diversification efforts have finally borne fruit. The [ROOT.GetAdjective] economy no longer has to depend solely on the production and export of fossil fuels, paving the way for a more sustainable future."
 GCC_empower_industrial_conglomerates:0 "Empower Industrial Conglomerates"
 GCC_empower_industrial_conglomerates_desc:0 "Our support for manufacturing has allowed industrial conglomerates to begin accumulating capital and influence. Supporting this new economic force will help consolidate our burgeoning secondary sector but will create a new power base that could seek to influence government policy."
 GCC_commit_to_domestic_merchants:0 "Commit to Domestic Merchants"
 GCC_commit_to_domestic_merchants_desc:0 "The merchant class has historically been key to the economy of [ROOT.GetNameDef] and as such has wielded significant influence in [ROOT.GetAdjective] affairs. We should remain committed to supporting these merchants in order to preserve the existing internal balance of power."
 GCC_cater_to_investors:0 "Cater to Investors"
 GCC_cater_to_investors_desc:0 "The future lies not in manufacturing or in traditional forms of commerce but in modern finance. As such we should develop [ROOT.GetNameDef] as a regional financial hub in order to insure our global relevance in this post-oil era."
 GCC_migrant_rights:0 "Migrant Rights"
 GCC_migrant_rights_desc:0 "Our unique demographic situation warrants attention. While our economy depends on the continued influx of migrants from the rest of the Middle East and South Asia, some of our subjects fear a dilution of [ROOT.GetAdjective] identity. In addition, we have drawn criticism for the poor conditions in which many migrants in [ROOT.GetNameDef] work in and the limited legal protections our government offers them."
 GCC_inclusive_policies:0 "Inclusive Policies"
 GCC_inclusive_policies_desc:0 "It is time for [ROOT.GetNameDef] to accept the centrality of immigrants in our society. We should do what we can to improve their living conditions and welcome them to this great country."
 GCC_amend_the_kafala_system:0 "Amend the Kafala System"
 GCC_amend_the_kafala_system_desc:0 "The kafala system requires migrant laborers to have in-country sponsers, in practice making them heavily dependent on their employers, opening them up to exploitation and abuse. Naturally, attempts to reform this system will be met with opposition from our country's various employers of migrant labor."
 GCC_minimum_wage:0 "Minimum Wage"
 GCC_minimum_wage_desc:0 "The lack of a minimum wage for migrant laborers has contributed to their poor living conditions and over-dependence on their employers. Their standard of living could be improved significantly by introducing one. However, this move will likely have an adverse effect on our economic activity."
 GCC_open_pathways_to_citizenship:0 "Open Pathways to Citizenship"
 GCC_open_pathways_to_citizenship_desc:0 "As long as migrants in [ROOT.GetNameDef] are denied citizenship they will remain subjugated and oppressed. We should make it easier for foreigners who have resided in this country for long enough to acquire citizenship. While this will increase our popularity with naturalized citizens, this policy will likely have the opposite effect on local residents, thereby increasing support for nativist political forces."
 GCC_exclusive_policies:0 "Exclusive Policies"
 GCC_exclusive_policies_desc:0 "The flood of migrants coming into [ROOT.GetNameDef] is a threat to our culture and our identity. We should protect the [ROOT.GetAdjective] people from this threat."
 GCC_reverse_naturalization:0 "Reverse Naturalization"
 GCC_reverse_naturalization_desc:0 "Although little naturalization of foreign migrants has taken place, we must revoke the citizenship of those foreigners who have managed to gain citizenship and prevent any further naturalization."
 GCC_impose_quotas:0 "Impose Quotas"
 GCC_impose_quotas_desc:0 "We should limit the number of migrants coming into the country to reduce the rate at which [ROOT.GetAdjective] culture is being eroded."
 GCC_maintain_exploitation:0 "Maintain Exploitation"
 GCC_maintain_exploitation_desc:0 "While we resent the corrupting influence of foreign migrants on our society and have done everything in our power to guard against the threat they pose, we must accept the necessity of foreign migrants for our continued economic growth."
 GCC_accelerated_growth:0 "Accelerated Growth"
 GCC_accelerated_growth_desc:0 "Our decision to ignore pressure to reform the kafala system has allowed us to continue utilizing our migrant population to its fullest extent."
 GCC_mass_deportation:0 "Mass Deportation"
 GCC_mass_deportation_desc:0 "Foreigners are a corrupting influence on our society and must be expelled for the good of the nation."
 GCC_empower_the_mutaween:0 "Favor Piety"
 GCC_empower_the_mutaween_desc:0 "The sharia is an important foundation of our legal system. However, there is more that we can do. The gradual, insidious encroachment of liberal values on our religious society must be stopped."
 GCC_weaken_the_mutaween:0 "Favor Reform"
 GCC_weaken_the_mutaween_desc:0 "The gradual trend in recent years in the region has been towards social liberalization. Instead of resisting this trend we should do what we can to support it."
 GCC_womens_rights:0 "Women's Rights"
 GCC_womens_rights_desc:0 "The fate of [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s women lies, as it always has, in the hands of [ROOT.GetAdjective] men. We must decide whether we wish to change this state of affairs or preserve the patriarchal status quo. Regardless of the approach we take, the status of our women is central to our identity as a nation."
 GCC_women_in_the_economy:0 "Women in the Economy"
 GCC_women_in_the_economy_desc:0 "Women have recently started to become more prominent in the business community, but this trend is still at an early stage. There is ample room for us to either support this trend or to combat it."
 GCC_women_in_politics:0 "Women in Politics"
 GCC_women_in_politics_desc:0 "The vast majority of official posts remain filled by men. We must decide whether to strive for gender equality or to keep women out of the political sphere."
 GCC_reform_personal_status_laws:0 "Reform Personal Status Laws"
 GCC_reform_personal_status_laws_desc:0 "The personal status laws are the area of our legal code that draws most upon sharia principles. As such, these laws heavily discriminate against women, for example by stating that legally a man is worth two women. Outdated laws like this should be revisited."
 GCC_political_affairs:0 "Political Affairs"
 GCC_political_affairs_desc:0 "Our rule faces many threats. Pro-democracy activists, Islamist radicals and so on directly challenge the legitimacy of our government. Whether we should take the criticisms of these detractors on board or harshly clamp down upon them is up to us."
 GCC_constitutional_monarchy:0 "Constitutional Monarchy"
 GCC_constitutional_monarchy_desc:0 "The time has come for the royal family to delegate some limited powers to an elected legislature. This will allow us to preserve our privileged position and the majority of our political authority while reducing pro-democracy pressure, at least for now."
