#read this if you plan on modding states in any capacity
#
#if you create a new state, remember these key things:	
 # transfer resources, factories, population etc accordingly (ex. if you split a state in two)
 # set the correct state_category according to the population (see the list at the bottom)
 # victory points be put in the correct state
 # make sure provinces don't overlap in two different states
 # buildings are corrected in nudge, that goes for unitstacks aswell if provinces are altered
 # if the game crashes on start up ask for help (its most likely air bases in wrong prov)
 # read the error log for any mentions of the former or new state
#
#if you mod in an existing state make sure that:
 # everything said above is correct
 # be more hesitant if your changes gives the country controlling the state more longterm advantages, as balance can be rubbed in favour to one country for something like adding an extra naval factory.
