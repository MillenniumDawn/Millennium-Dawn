 germany.1.t:0 "Coal Industry Compromise"
 germany.1.d:0 "In 1998, the Greens accepted SPD primacy in regards to labour policy. But with approval ratings rapidly turning further and further away from fossil fuels, the initally well-supported labour unions have found themselves with their back to the wall in their argumentation as to why brown coal industry jobs need to be preserved at all costs.\n\nThe SPD still stands in solidarity with the coal jobs, whereas the Greens have renewed ambition to accelerate the transition to renewed energy."
 germany.1.o1:0 "The SPD is justified."
 germany.1.o2:0 "The Greens are right."
