 SOL_developing_nation_category_desc: "[?SOL.GetName|Y] is a small island nation with very little in the way of industry and essentially no economic power internationally. What we do have is a vote at the UN, and a few powerful neighbours that are very concerned with geopolitics.

 solomon_competition.1.d: "Having little industry of their own, the small island nation of the [?SOL.GetName|Y] has approached us with a request to help them setup some industry.

 solomon_competition.5.t: "A Need For Infrastructure"
 solomon_competition.5.d: "Our population has grown steadily larger over the years. The lifestyle that has sustained us for so long is no longer sufficient to support our people.

We should approach our powerful neighbours for assistance."

 solomon_competition.10.d: "It seems that the 21st century will bring with it a new world. The age of the internet is here and our people want a slice of it.

Getting a small island setup with the internet is an expensive business though and we'll need assistance from our neighbours."
 solomon_competition.10.o1: "Let's get connected!"

 solomon_competition.25.t: "Growing Unrest"
 solomon_competition.25.d: "In recent years, the government has progressively lost control over a significant portion of the country. Our economy is declining and we've been unable to pay our public servants. Worse still, tensions between the Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM) from Guadalcanal and Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) from their neighbours in Malaita are growing more severe. The lack of funds is making it impossible for our government to do anything."
 solomon_competition.25.o1: "Maybe things will improve?"

 solomon_competition.26.t: "Violence Erupts"
 solomon_competition.26.d: "Violent clashes between the IFM and MEF have broken out across the country. It's lead to a breakdown of law and order, paralysing public services and displacing thousands. This is becoming a serious humanitarian crisis."

 solomon_competition.27.d2: "The [?SOL.GetName|Y] embassy in [?CHI.capital.GetName|Y] has contacted us with an interesting development. Ethnic tensions have flared across the country and a major humanitarian crisis is currently unfolding. Surprisingly their major neighbour [?AST.GetName|Y] has declined to assist them. They've requested our assistance with restoring law and order to the region. This may become a major undertaking and will require a long term commitment. This could be an excellent opportunity to build our influence in the pacific."

 solomon_competition.27.o2: "Let's see how this plays out..."

 solomon_competition.28.t: "Operation RAMSI"

 solomon_competition.29.t: "Operation RAMSI"
 solomon_competition.29.d: "Our requests for international assistance have been rejected on all fronts! We're on our own in this crisis. How many poor innocents will suffer because of the heartlessness of the international community?"

 solomon_competition.30.t: "Foreign Forces Arrive In [?SOL.GetName|Y]"
 solomon_competition.30.d: "Military and humanitarian resources are flowing into the country from [?SOL.RAMSI_supporter.GetName|Y].

The situation is still very tense and more work needs to be done to restore order."
 solomon_competition.30.o1: "A promising start"

 solomon_competition.31.t: "Disarming [?SOL.GetName|Y]"
 solomon_competition.31.d: "The government in [?SOL.RAMSI_supporter.GetName|Y] has initiated a gun buyback program in the [?SOL.GetName|Y]. There's simply no reason for such a small country to have so many weapons. The program has been a success and much of the country's population has been disarmed."
 solomon_competition.31.o1: "Destroy the guns"
 solomon_competition.31.o2: "This was a good idea"

 solomon_competition.32.t: "[?SOL.GetName|Y] Government Restored"
 solomon_competition.32.d1: "[?SOL.RAMSI_supporter.GetName|Y] has been working hard to restore the government in [?SOL.GetName|Y].

 solomon_competition.32.o2: "Good luck to them"
 solomon_competition.32.o3: "Uh oh..."
 solomon_competition.32.o4: "Stability returns"

 solomon_competition.33.o1: "Mission accomplished"
