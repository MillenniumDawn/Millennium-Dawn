 AST_Final_Years_of_Howards_Second_Term: "Turbulent Times"
 AST_Final_Years_of_Howards_Second_Term_desc: "As Australia approaches the 2001 federal elections, John Howard is an unpopular prime minister, who many want to see resign or be voted out of office. There is also high dissatisfaction with the Liberal/National coalition. A big question on voters minds is if the countrys second biggest airline, Ansett Australia, should be bailed out. Labour supports a bailout because it would represent a significant loss of jobs, but the ruling coalition does not since they do not see it as the governments fault."
 AST_The_Effects_of_GST: "The Effects of GST"
 AST_The_Effects_of_GST_desc: "A Goods and Services Tax, or a GST, is similar to what many Europeans would call a Value-Added Tax or (VAT). The Howard government passed legislation to establish a GST on 28 June 1999 as A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999. It gained assent on 8 July 1999 and came into operation on 1 July 2000. The government initially said that exemptions to GST were not possible, and hoped to pass the GST legislation with the support of independent Senator Harradine, but he ultimately voted against the legislation. However a compromise was eventually reached, involving most basic food items being exempt from GST, the GST on library purchases of books being refunded, a temporary 8% refund on school textbooks, increases to welfare payments, and greater powers to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission to oversee the implementation of the new tax regime."
 AST_Working_with_the_Party: "Working with the Party"

The electorate was gripped by the suspense of the impending vote, with all eyes on the candidates, eager to see who would emerge victorious."
 AST_The_Labor_Party: "The Labor Party"
 AST_The_Labor_Party_desc: "The Australian Labor Party is the major center-left opposition party. The party balances progressive and centrist policies between its factions.

 AST_Strengthen_the_Labor_right: "Strengthen the Labor Right"
 AST_Strengthen_the_Labor_right_desc: "Labor's Right focuses on economic growth, fiscal responsibility and market-friendly policies.

 AST_Increase_the_power_of_the_Labor_left: "Increase the Power of the the Labor Left"
 AST_Increase_the_power_of_the_Labor_left_desc: "Labor's Left is more progressive and social-democratic than the Right.

They support a more independent foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States."
 AST_influence_the_factions: "Influence the Factions"
 AST_influence_the_factions_desc: ""
 AST_Branch_Stacking: "Branch Stacking"
 AST_Branch_Stacking_desc: "To ensure the Labor Party's success in future elections, we should position loyal party members in branches where their votes can significantly impact the outcome of internal party elections in our favour. This will allow us to ensure that our preferred candidates are preselected for elections and ensure that our faction gains control over party decisions. The practice is considered unethical and risks increasing the country's political corruption."
 AST_Influence_the_Unions: "Influence the Unions"
 AST_Influence_the_Unions_desc: "The Labor Party has a long history with Australia's labor unions. The unions have large numbers of members that could benefit our cause monetarily and politically. Supporting the unions gives us legitimacy as representatives of the working-class's interests."

 AST_Expand_the_power_of_the_trade_unions_in_the_party_desc: "Trade unions fight for worker's rights, fair wages, job security and better working conditions.

 AST_Look_towards_Keynesianism: "Look Towards Keynesianism"
 AST_Look_towards_Keynesianism_desc: "Keynesianism is an economic philosophy that is focused on aggregate demand, the idea that total demand for goods and services is the primary driver of economic activity and employment levels. The philosophy advocates for active government intervention to keep the economy stable. Countercyclical spending is a core concept that encourages governments to spend more and lower taxes during the bad times, and the reverse during economic booms. Our government should look to Keynes's wisdom when considering macroeconomic policies."
 AST_Push_for_slow_change_in_the_party: "Encourage A Conservative Approach"
 AST_Push_for_slow_change_in_the_party_desc: "While Labor is a left leaning party, we should take a slower approach to our social policies to avoid alienating potential voters.
