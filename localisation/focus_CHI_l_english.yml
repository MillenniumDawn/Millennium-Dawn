  CHI_End_PLA_Business_Ventures_desc:0 "In order to make up for defence budget cuts, the country’s military, the PLA, started acquiring business ventures in the 1970s. However the government has recently started to become concerned by this phenomenon. A new directive to remove the PLA from most sectors of the economy is therefore necessary, but in order to placate the military we must implement this alongside an increase in the budget."
  CHI_Future_of_the_CPC:0 "The Future of the CPC"
  CHI_Future_of_the_CPC_desc:0 "As much as the Communist Party of China likes to present itself as a strong, united entity, it is not immune to fissures along factional lines. We must choose which, if any faction we desire to favour."
  CHI_Three_Represents_Thought:0 "Three Represents Thought"
  CHI_Three_Represents_Thought_desc:0 "The “Three Represents” is a theory of what the Communist Party represents as put forward by Jiang Zemin.

  CHI_End_Class_Warfare:0 "End Class Warfare"
  CHI_End_Class_Warfare_desc:0 "As a result of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents Thought”, the foundations of Chinese political thought have been substantially, if subtly amended. While Mao’s underlying ideology relied on class warfare in favour of the rural peasants against the urban bourgeoisie, Jiang’s more pro-business orientation has led him to favour an end to this aspect of Chinese governance."

  CHI_Peaceful_Rise:0 "China's Peaceful Rise"
  CHI_Peaceful_Rise_desc:0 "The perception of China as a threat to international peace and security is not uncommon in the US and amongst our neighbours. To counter this, we should adopt the official policy of “China’s peaceful rise” or, to put it in an even less threatening way, “China’s peaceful development”. This will assure our Western and regional partners that we do not seek conflict."

  CHI_Green_GDP:0 "Green GDP"
  CHI_Green_GDP_desc:0 "A key tenet of the scientific outlook on development is sustainability.

  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Agenda_desc:0 "The strengthening of the Shanghai Clique has paved the way for Jiang Zemin’s so-called “hatchet man” to assume leadership of the Communist Party and the nation.

  CHI_Affirm_Ties_to_the_Military:0 "Affirm Ties to the Military"
  CHI_Affirm_Ties_to_the_Military_desc:0 "In order to make changes to the composition of the Communist Party, Zeng Qinghong must make use of his connections to powerful military generals. These ties must be strengthened before any inevitably unpopular reformist agenda is pursued."

  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Thought_desc:0 "Building upon Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, Zeng has formulated a new ideological underpinning for the CPC, one that stresses the duty of the party to represent the majority of Chinese people. Zeng Qinghong thought calls for a more accountable and transparent party that can be perceived as more representative and legitimate by the Chinese people."
  CHI_Intra_Party_Democracy:0 "Intra-Party Democracy"
  CHI_Intra_Party_Democracy_desc:0 "One of Zeng Qinghong’s key ideas is that of intra-party democracy, in which elections are used to select local-level party secretaries.

  CHI_Public_Examinations_desc:0 "In order to fill the Communist Party apparatus with the most competent officials possible, Zeng has ordered that all lower-level posts should be filled through rigorous public examinations rather than by appointment.

  CHI_Succession_Question:0 "The Succession Question"
  CHI_Succession_Question_desc:0 "While the princeling vice-president Xi Jinping is widely considered to be the most likely choice to succeed the current president, his fellow princeling Bo Xilai has been a rising star in Chinese politics for several years now and came close to threatening Xi’s ascension to the position of vice-president."

  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Agenda:0 "Xi Jinping's Agenda"
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Agenda_desc:0 "With Bo Xilai out of the way, the path is clear for a smooth transition of power to vice-president Xi Jinping.

  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Thought:0 "Xi Jinping Thought"
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Thought_desc:0 "Xi Jinping's contribution to the theoretical basis of the CPC's rule is one that establishes a large number of lofty goals for the party.

  CHI_Flowing_Spring_desc:0 "Taking his Chinese Dream to the next level, Xi Jinping has drawn on a poem from the 8th century BCE entitled "Flowing Spring" which concerns regaining greatness and prosperity.

  CHI_Xiaokang_Society:0 "Xiaokang Society"
  CHI_Xiaokang_Society_desc:0 "The idea of a moderately prosperous society is not a new one in Chinese politics. Nonethless, Xi Jinping has decided to give this concept a new lease of life, calling upon the nation to strive for a country that is equally and only moderately well-off."

  CHI_Establish_the_Central_Group_for_Military_Reform_desc:0 "While a strong institution, the PLA still lags behind the militaries of some of our more advanced rivals. To become a world-class force we should establish a group to formulate possible reforms."

  CHI_Weaken_the_Youth_League_desc:0 "The populist coalition headed by the Tuanpai or Youth League Faction retains significant influence due to the significant degree of independence possessed by the Communist Youth League.

  CHI_Humanist_Marxism_desc:0 "The "New Left" ideology put forward by Bo Xilai and others is one that favours a return to aspects of Maoist socialism such as state-planning and collectivism. Now that he has come to power, Bo can pursue his leftist agenda under the banner of "humanist marxism"."
  CHI_Nanjie_Model:0 "The Nanjie Model"
  CHI_Nanjie_Model_desc:0 "In many ways a development of the Chongqing model, the Nanjie model retains many elements of Bo's original theory but draws on the example of Nanjie village, a stronghold of Maoism that retains a collectivist system. Bo's Nanjie model calls on China to heed Nanjie's example, and leave behind capitalism and the free-market in favour of true socialism."
  CHI_Purge_Tuanpai:0 "Purge the Tuanpai"

  CHI_Bo_Xilai_Agenda_desc:0 "Following the rise to power of the princelings and the political chaos that followed the purge of the Youth League faction, Bo Xilai has managed to come out on top by distinguishing himself from his fellow princelings with his ardent "New Left" ideology. Bo will now be free to pursue his somewhat controversial vision for Chinese politics."
  CHI_Scrap_Military_Commands:0 "Scrap Military Commands"
  CHI_Scrap_Military_Commands_desc:0 "The PLA's seven military commands are overly cumbersome and would hinder the ability of different units to coordinate in the event of a large-scale conflict. To remedy this, we should regroup these military commands into four strategic zones: North, South, East and West. However, this change will not come without consequences, as many military officers will resist this disruption."
  CHI_Cut_Ground_Troop_Numbers:0 "Cut Ground Troop Numbers"
  CHI_Cut_Ground_Troop_Numbers_desc:0 "Quantity is not an issue for the PLA, but quality is. Moreover, the PLA Ground Forces dwarf the other arms of the military, meaning we are burdened with an overly landlocked, cumbersome force. In order to make our military more mobile, nimble, and responsive, we should reduce our reliance on the ground forces by cutting troop numbers."
  CHI_Stamp_Out_Corruption:0 "Stamp Out Corruption"
  CHI_Stamp_Out_Corruption_desc:0 "One of the biggest hurdles to making the PLA a modern military on par with those of the West is corruption. We should use the Central Military Commission to crackdown on any signs of corruption that we can find."
