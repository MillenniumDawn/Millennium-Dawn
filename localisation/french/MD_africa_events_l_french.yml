Depuis lors, la Côte d'Ivoire est dirigée par le Comité national de salut public, une junte militaire. De nombreux Ivoiriens ont salué le coup d'État, affirmant qu'ils espéraient que l'armée améliorerait la situation économique et politique précaire de la Côte d'Ivoire, mais des pressions s'exercent désormais pour un retour à un régime civil. La question est de savoir si nous devrions permettre aux travailleurs migrants, qui constituent la majeure partie de la population du nord, de se présenter aux élections."
