 GER_conservative_ties_to_the_automotive_industry:0 "CDU Ties to the Automotive Industry"
 GER_conservative_ties_to_the_automotive_industry_desc:0 "While the Christian conservative CDU/CSU is not as deeply connected to the automotive industry as Gerhard Schröder is with Volkswagen, several important German car manufacturers are still located in predominantly conservative states in the south, notably Porsche and Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg and BMW in Munich, Bavaria."
 GER_automotive_investments_in_europe:0 "Automotive Investments in Europe"
 GER_automotive_investments_in_europe_desc:0 "By aggressively pushing into other European markets, German car manufacturers could drastically reduce their personnel costs by leaving German industry and thus German wages behind in favor of European Union member states with lower standards of living. Mercedes-Benz seeks additional investments in Kecskemét, Hungary, whereas Volkswagen desires support for expansion in Bratislava, Slovakia."
 GER_strengthen_volkswagen:0 "Strengthen Volkswagen"
 GER_strengthen_volkswagen_desc:0 "The German Ministry of Finance found that 30% of jobs in Lower Saxony are either directly provided by or indirectly dependent on Volkswagen, the largest company in Germany and Germany's main corporate applicant of soft power abroad. Several percentage points of the German economy are solely provided by this one company - it is too big to fail."
 GER_seize_opposition_weakness:0 "Seize Opposition Weakness"
 GER_seize_opposition_weakness_desc:0 "With the Möllermann crisis in the FDP and the corruption scandal in the CDU/CSU, the opposition to Gerhard Schröder's SPD (red) and Joschka Fischer's Greens, who together form the government as the 'red-green coalition', is weaker than ever. This comes at an opportune moment, as the year 1999 had held several weak electoral results for the governing parties, even in traditionally left-leaning states."
 GER_utilize_spd_influence_in_lower_saxony:0 "Utilize SPD Influence in Lower Saxony"
 GER_utilize_spd_influence_in_lower_saxony_desc:0 "Historically, the German Social Democrats, the SPD, played second fiddle to the much stronger CDU/CSU, the 'Union'. Only in 1998 did Gerhard Schröder dethrone four-term incumbent Helmut Kohl of the CDU. Schröder's power base lies in his home in Lower Saxony, one of the most loyal SPD voting states that is also home to Germany's largest company, Volkswagen, a political ally of Schröder."
 GER_infrastructural_reform:0 "Infrastructural Reform"
 GER_infrastructural_reform_desc:0 "Because of a brewing political crisis involving Minister of Infrastructure Reinhard Klimmt and his associated football club, 1. FC Saarbrücken, Klimmt should be replaced with a new Federal Minister for Traffic, Construction and Housing. Kurt Bodewig would be a worthwhile replacement."
 GER_coal_industry_compromise:0 "Coal Industry Compromise"
 GER_coal_industry_compromise_desc:0 "While SPD and Greens were united in their opposition to the liberal decisionmaking of the Union and the FDP, the downfall of Oskar Lafontaine in 1999 and the rise of Schröder's Clintonite ideology presented a clear dissonance between Greens and SPD: Whereas Fischer seeks to eliminate fossil fuel usage, the SPD wants to preserve laborers in the industry. The main conflict has always been brown coal."
 GER_foreign_policy_pragmatism:0 "Foreign Policy Pragmatism"
 GER_foreign_policy_pragmatism_desc:0 "The Schröder government has made several severe miscalculations during its first two years in office. The chancellor's push for a permanent German seat on the UN Security Council combined with a half-hearted attempt to pursue European Federalism, both of which alienated Germany's closest European partner, France. SPD and Greens need to realized the error of their ways."
 GER_limited_haushaltskonsolidierung:0 "Limited Budget Consolidation"
 GER_limited_haushaltskonsolidierung_desc:0 "One of the Schröder administration's primary goals in office, the Haushaltskonsolidierung, 'budget consolidation', is not going to happen. The budget has kept bloating under social democratic leadership and private debt keeps growing on both a per capita and a per household basis. All Germany can do now is to introduce limited budget cuts in areas like defense spending to minimize the damage."
 GER_green_card_initiative:0 "Green Card Initiative"
 GER_green_card_initiative_desc:0 "Inspired by American and Canadian immigration programs, the Schröder government has proposed the introduction of a 'Green-Card-Initiative' to quickly assemble foreign IT workers to accerelate the development of Germany's underdeveloped high-technology sector. The Kohl government before Schröder had neglected both internet and IT development, and this needs to be amended."
 GER_pension_reform:0 "Pension Reform"
 GER_pension_reform_desc:0 "One of the key talking points of the German social democrats against German conservatives has always been the size of pensions, and the electoral battle between Schröder and Kohl in 1998 was no different. Should the Schröder administration fail to at least provide token relief to Germany's elderly, the SPD's prestige among the working class would collapse utterly."
 GER_digitalized_education_system:0 "Digitalized Education System"
 GER_digitalized_education_system_desc:0 "One of Schröder's core promises during the 1998 campaign was 'Schulen ans Netz', 'schools onto the web', referring to the low rate of internet access and digitalization among German elementary and even high schools during the Kohl Administration. Seeing the 'Schulen ans Netz' program succeed would be costly, but hugely beneficial to Germany's pupils."
 GER_schroeder_ii:0 "Schröder II"
 GER_schroeder_ii_desc:0 "After assuming a first term as chancellor in 1998, Schröder has won several resounding political victories. The CDU and FDP crises regarding Kohl and Möllermann, respectively, have greatly diminished the conservatives' chances to win the election. Schröder's run for re-election could however still need some campaign boosts - like declining to join American wars of aggression."
 GER_auffangbank_concept:0 "'Auffangbank' Concept"
 GER_auffangbank_concept_desc:0 "Inspired by American Resolution Trust Corporations, or RTCs, the Schröder administration has brianstormed the creation of a German 'bad bank'-esque financial institute to predict and avoid future financial crises. But that would never happen, now would it?"
 GER_homegrown_software:0 "Homegrown Software"
 GER_homegrown_software_desc:0 "With the 'Schulen ans Netz' program in full effect, the funds should now also be diverted towards German multimedia companies like Nuremberg-based SoftMaker to develop utility and office programs to dissuade American-made software at the workplace. The German government could also subsidize the acquisition of licenses for such programs to double the incentive."
 GER_agenda_2010:0 "Agenda 2010"
 GER_agenda_2010_desc:0 "Gerhard Schröder was always a moderate among the social democrats and thus advocated restraint with the budget. The 'Agenda 2010' is an ambitious project of budget cuts and bureaucratic reforms that will without a doubt draw heavy criticism from leftist groups and push the government towards the center - but it could be fantastic for economic progress."
 GER_sports_funding:0 "Sports Funding"
 GER_sports_funding_desc:0 "In German politics, it usually proves very effective to generate domestic profit as well as political capital by funding and supporting sporting projects, particularly football stadiums."
 GER_hartz_iv:0 "Hartz IV"
 GER_hartz_iv_desc:0 "The 'Commission for Modern Services at the Labor Market', called the 'Hartz Commission' for its leader Peter Hartz, had to develop a new concept for the service market, categorized as Hartz I through Hartz IV. Hartz IV in particular, the new ruling on unemployment benefits, stands heavily against classical social democratic values and will garner heavy criticism from traditional SPD voters."
 GER_sonderparteitag:0 "Sonderparteitag"
 GER_sonderparteitag_desc:0 "Since Lafontaine's withdrawal, Schröder's support among left-wing forces in Germany has been waning. Juggling the interests of employers and employees, of unions and corporations, of the economy and the working class has been controversial, to say the least. Gerhard Schröder, to save face, must now pass party leadership to fully focus on his office as Federal Chancellor."
 GER_vertrauensfrage:0 "Vertrauensfrage"
 GER_vertrauensfrage_desc:0 "Schröder has been unable to keep the Greens in line and his own SPD behind him. His primary way of enforcing his own policies has been to threaten his resignation and to thus threaten the remaining stability of the coalition. Now, with public support definitely gone, it is time to call a vote of confidence, a 'Vertrauensfrage'. Schröder fully intends to lose this vote and to call for immediate re-elections."
 GER_schroeder_iii:0 "Schröder III"
 GER_schroeder_iii_desc:0 "The political power move has worked: Schröder secures his third term as Federal Chancellor and can now assemble a new coalition, either with the neoliberal FDP or the progressive Greens. Both the leftist PDS and the conservative CDU/CSU are unlikely to approve of this result and will continue hard-fought opposition to SPD policy."
 GER_angela_merkel:0 "Angela Merkel"
 GER_angela_merkel_desc:0 "With the lost Vertrauensfrage, Schröder's political capital and reputation with the German people was totally depleted. It was relatively easy for the conservative CDU/CSU, the 'Union', to pick up the pieces and sweep the election. Helmut Kohl's personal protegé, Angela Merkel, will be the main beneficiary. She will be the eighth Federal Chancellor of the FRG and the first woman to fill that post."
 GER_bmvi:0 "BMVI"
 GER_bmvi_desc:0 "Creating a Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure is part of the Merkel government's plan to drive forward digitalization efforts. This 'BMVI' will replace the BMVBS."
 GER_digitalrat:0 "Digitalrat"
 GER_digitalrat_desc:0 "Called upon by the Merkel IV cabinet, a digital council was established in 2018. Consisting of forward-thinking giants and innovative start up CEOs of multimedia and innovation, the chancellor's new digital advisor elite will provide her with more effective and profitable plans for Germany's digitalization efforts."

 GER_german_nationalism:0 "German Nationalism"
 GER_german_nationalism_desc:0 "Since the defeats in the world wars, the German people have culturally been more reserved about patriotic outbursts and displays of nationalism than other comparable societies."
