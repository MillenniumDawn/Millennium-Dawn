 Burma.1.d:0 "The government of Myanmar, wary of China’s growing ambitions and pessimistic about ASEAN’s ability to contain these ambitions, has come to us to address their concerns. Should we grant them the assistance that they desire?"
 Burma.1.a:0 "Yes, we need to contain China"
 Burma.1.b:0 "No, Myanmar is not a worthy ally"

 #News Events#
 
 Burma_News.1.t:0 "A New Path for Myanmar?"
 Burma_News.1.d:0 "The military government today announced that the decades long process of drafting a new constitution has finally been completed. While the new constitution marks a liberalising shift in Myanmar’s politics, it nonetheless preserves the military’s continued role in government, such as by ensuring its possession of 25% of the seats in parliament. It remains to be seen whether this constitution will be a vehicle for democratisation or a tool for continued military domination."

 Burma_News.2.t:0 "Aung San Suu Kyi Released"

 Burma_News.4.t:0 "A quiet struggle for dominance"
 Burma_News.4.d:0 "Reports are beginning to emerge about attempts by the civilian government of Myanmar to undermine the political influence of the country’s military, the tatmadaw. While the military’s material strength is undoubtedly superior, analysts predict that the civilian government will seek to undermine the military’s popular support and pressure the military indirectly through supporting popular protest. How the tatmadaw will react to these moves remains uncertain."

 Burma_News.5.t:0 "An End to Peace"

 Burma_News.6.t:0 "The {root.getname}"

 Burma_News.6.a:0 "This was inevitable"

 Insurgency.11.t:0 "The government has offered us a ceasefire"
 Insurgency.11.d:0 "Clearly in awe of our military prowess, the cowardly Tatmadaw has requested a cessation of hostilities. As despicable as our enemies are, a ceasefire may also be in our own interests, as we can use this opportunity to push for concessions from the Burmese."

 Insurgency.11.b:0 "We should make moderate demands."

 Insurgency.12.a:0 "Accept their demands"
 Insurgency.12.b:0 "Reject their demands"
 Insurgency.13.t:0 "The rebels are making reasonable demands"

 Insurgency.18.t:0 "The government has invited us to negotiations of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement"
 Insurgency.18.d:0 "The new government has announced an ambitious proposal to make peace with all of the major ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) in Myanmar.

 Insurgency.18.a:0 "Let's see how this goes."
 Insurgency.18.b:0 "This is a waste of time."
 Insurgency.19.t:0 "The First Round of Negotiations"
 Insurgency.19.d:0 "One of the most significant issues regarding the conflict in Myanmar is whether the state of Myanmar should be a union or a federation. Historically, the Burmese government has refused to accept the possibility of Myanmar becoming a federation, as, painfully aware of the legacy of colonial divide-and-rule, it fears that such a move would lead to the disintegration of the country. The ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) on the other hand have insisted on the need for a more representative form of government. Going forward in these negotiations, we should establish what our negotiation position on this particular issue is."
 Insurgency.19.a:0 "We must preserve the Union."
 Insurgency.19.b:0 "Times are changing and so must we, we should become a Federation."
 Insurgency.19.c:0 "We should compromise on this point."
 Insurgency.20.t:0 "The Second Round of Negotiations"
 Insurgency.20.d:0 "The next issue on the agenda concerns the composition of the Tatmadaw. Many EAOs argue that the nation's armed forces cannot be overwhelmingly dominated by Buddhists and ethnic Burmans as it is at the moment. We must consider whether or not to address these concerns."
 Insurgency.20.a:0 "Keep to the status quo."
 Insurgency.20.b:0 "Commit ourselves to improving minority representation in the military." 
 Insurgency.20.c:0 "This issue is too significant to decide right now."
 Insurgency.21.t:0 "The Final Round of Negotiations"
 Insurgency.21.d:0 "The biggest stumbling block that we have encountered in these negotiations is whether to pursue disarmament, demobalization and reintegration (DDR) or security sector reform (SSR). The Tatmadaw has historically preferred DDR due to its desire to completely disarm the EAOs or bring them under its own command. The EAOs however have preferred SSR, a framework which would allow them to be integrated into the country's security sector whilst keeping their arms and their autonomy. We should consider the best solution to this impasse."
 Insurgency.21.a:0 "They cannot keep their arms. We choose DDR."
 Insurgency.21.b:0 "We must make some sacrifices, and so will accept SSR."
 Insurgency.21.c:0 "This issue is too important to decide at this moment."
 Insurgency.22.t:0 "We are satisfied with this draft"
 Insurgency.22.d:0 "The government has made enough concessions for us to bring this signed draft back to our people and carry ourselves with pride."
 Insurgency.22.a:0 "We will sign."
 Insurgency.23.t:0 "This draft is not acceptable!"
 Insurgency.23.d:0 "The government and the military clearly have no desire to draft an agreement worth any more than the paper is printed on! If we were to take this back to our people they would surely skin us alive."
 Insurgency.23.a:0 "We will not sign!"
 Insurgency.24.t:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has signed the NCA!"
 Insurgency.24.d:0 "Finding our negotiation position tolerable, the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has joined us in signing this historic document."
 Insurgency.24.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 Insurgency.25.t:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has refused to sign the NCA!"
 Insurgency.25.d:0 "Citing our 'unreasonable' demands, the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has refused to join us in signing this historic document."
 Insurgency.25.a:0 "Their loss."
