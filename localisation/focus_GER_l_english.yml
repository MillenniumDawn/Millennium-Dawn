 GER_conservative_ties_to_the_automotive_industry:0 "CDU Ties to the Automotive Industry"
 GER_conservative_ties_to_the_automotive_industry_desc:0 "While the Christian conservative CDU/CSU is not as deeply connected to the automotive industry as Gerhard Schröder is with Volkswagen, several important German car manufacturers are still located in predominantly conservative states in the south, notably Porsche and Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg and BMW in Munich, Bavaria."
 GER_automotive_investments_in_europe:0 "Automotive Investments in Europe"
 GER_automotive_investments_in_europe_desc:0 "By aggressively pushing into other European markets, German car manufacturers could drastically reduce their personnel costs by leaving German industry and thus German wages behind in favor of European Union member states with lower standards of living. Mercedes-Benz seeks additional investments in Kecskemét, Hungary, whereas Volkswagen desires support for expansion in Bratislava, Slovakia."
 GER_strengthen_volkswagen:0 "Strengthen Volkswagen"
 GER_strengthen_volkswagen_desc:0 "The German Ministry of Finance found that 30% of jobs in Lower Saxony are either directly provided by or indirectly dependent on Volkswagen, the largest company in Germany and Germany's main corporate applicant of soft power abroad. Several percentage points of the German economy are solely provided by this one company - it is too big to fail."
 GER_seize_opposition_weakness:0 "Seize Opposition Weakness"
 GER_seize_opposition_weakness_desc:0 "With the Möllermann crisis in the FDP and the corruption scandal in the CDU/CSU, the opposition to Gerhard Schröder's SPD (red) and Joschka Fischer's Greens, who together form the government as the 'red-green coalition', is weaker than ever. This comes at an opportune moment, as the year 1999 had held several weak electoral results for the governing parties, even in traditionally left-leaning states."
 GER_utilize_spd_influence_in_lower_saxony:0 "Utilize SPD Influence in Lower Saxony"
 GER_utilize_spd_influence_in_lower_saxony_desc:0 "Historically, the German Social Democrats, the SPD, played second fiddle to the much stronger CDU/CSU, the 'Union'. Only in 1998 did Gerhard Schröder dethrone four-term incumbent Helmut Kohl of the CDU. Schröder's power base lies in his home in Lower Saxony, one of the most loyal SPD voting states that is also home to Germany's largest company, Volkswagen, a political ally of Schröder."
 GER_infrastructural_reform:0 "Infrastructural Reform"
 GER_infrastructural_reform_desc:0 "Because of a brewing political crisis involving Minister of Infrastructure Reinhard Klimmt and his associated football club, 1. FC Saarbrücken, Klimmt should be replaced with a new Federal Minister for Traffic, Construction and Housing. Kurt Bodewig would be a worthwhile replacement."
 GER_coal_industry_compromise:0 "Coal Industry Compromise"
 GER_coal_industry_compromise_desc:0 "While SPD and Greens were united in their opposition to the liberal decisionmaking of the Union and the FDP, the downfall of Oskar Lafontaine in 1999 and the rise of Schröder's Clintonite ideology presented a clear dissonance between Greens and SPD: Whereas Fischer seeks to eliminate fossil fuel usage, the SPD wants to preserve laborers in the industry. The main conflict has always been brown coal."
 GER_foreign_policy_pragmatism:0 "Foreign Policy Pragmatism"
 GER_foreign_policy_pragmatism_desc:0 "The Schröder government has made several severe miscalculations during its first two years in office. The chancellor's push for a permanent German seat on the UN Security Council combined with a half-hearted attempt to pursue European Federalism, both of which alienated Germany's closest European partner, France. SPD and Greens need to realized the error of their ways."
 GER_limited_haushaltskonsolidierung:0 "Limited Budget Consolidation"
 GER_limited_haushaltskonsolidierung_desc:0 "One of the Schröder administration's primary goals in office, the Haushaltskonsolidierung, 'budget consolidation', is not going to happen. The budget has kept bloating under social democratic leadership and private debt keeps growing on both a per capita and a per household basis. All Germany can do now is to introduce limited budget cuts in areas like defense spending to minimize the damage."
 GER_green_card_initiative:0 "Green Card Initiative"
 GER_green_card_initiative_desc:0 "Inspired by American and Canadian immigration programs, the Schröder government has proposed the introduction of a 'Green-Card-Initiative' to quickly assemble foreign IT workers to accerelate the development of Germany's underdeveloped high-technology sector. The Kohl government before Schröder had neglected both internet and IT development, and this needs to be amended."
 GER_pension_reform:0 "Pension Reform"
 GER_pension_reform_desc:0 "One of the key talking points of the German social democrats against German conservatives has always been the size of pensions, and the electoral battle between Schröder and Kohl in 1998 was no different. Should the Schröder administration fail to at least provide token relief to Germany's elderly, the SPD's prestige among the working class would collapse utterly."
 GER_digitalized_education_system:0 "Digitalized Education System"
 GER_digitalized_education_system_desc:0 "One of Schröder's core promises during the 1998 campaign was 'Schulen ans Netz', 'schools onto the web', referring to the low rate of internet access and digitalization among German elementary and even high schools during the Kohl Administration. Seeing the 'Schulen ans Netz' program succeed would be costly, but hugely beneficial to Germany's pupils."
 GER_improved_federal_education_standards:0 "Improved Federal Education Standards"
 GER_improved_federal_education_standards_desc:0 "In Germany, the concept of "Bildungshoheit der Länder", the 'state supremacy in education', takes away federal control of education policy and allows individual states to more autonomously set their own goals. The downside of this system is that some states' education like NRW and Bremen have fallen in prestige and standard behind that of states like Bavaria. This can be amended by federal minimums."
 GER_international_business:0 "International Business"
 GER_international_business_desc:0 "Germany often hails itself "Exportweltmeister", 'world champion of exports'. The German economy has traditionally seen significant trade surplusses, selling far more to other industrial nations than Germany itself purchases from them. A continuation of an export-friendly policy requires great amounts of foreign political pragmatism - the money of a dictator is just as good as the money of a popular leader, after all."
 GER_sino_german_deals:0 "Sino-German Deals"
 GER_sino_german_deals_desc:0 "Germany punches far above its weight when it comes to its export economy. The only country that comes anywhere close is the People's Republic of China, which sports more than 20 times the German population to power its insatiable economic engine. China is desperate for any way to power and more growth - the Chinese want German machines, German cars and the know-how of German companies."
 GER_oil_trade_negotiations:0 "Oil Trade Negotiations"
 GER_oil_trade_negotiations_desc:0 ""
 GER_nord_stream:0 "Nord Stream"
 GER_nord_stream_desc:0 "Schröder is notoriously friendly to Vladimir Putin, Russia's autocrat. The Russo-German trade relations revolve around Russian natural resources and their usage in Germany. Russian gas giant Gazprom has a plan to bypass Ukrainian and Polish oversight by getting Russian gas straight into Germany through a pipeline in the Baltic, "Nord Stream". This plan is great for German profits, but Eastern Europe won't like it."
 GER_appease_eastern_europe:0 "Appease Eastern Europe"
 GER_appease_eastern_europe_desc:0 "Our investments into Nord Stream pose a significant threat to Polish, Slovak, Czech and Ukrainian trade and transit profits regarding Russian oil delivered to Germany and the rest of western Europe. We have to trade the line carefully now, as to avoid completely alienating our reliable partners. Russia is not trustworthy enough to make that trade off worthwhile."
 GER_accomodate_polish_migrant_workers:0 "Accomodate Polish Migrant Workers"
 GER_accomodate_polish_migrant_workers_desc:0 ""
 GER_russo_german_partnership:0 "Russo-German Partnership"
 GER_russo_german_partnership_desc:0 "Polish defense minister Radoslaw Sikorski already likened our new business deals with the Russians to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It is clear that our critics are incorrect about the Poles and their friends being more reliable than the Russians - they too are just out to backstab us at an opportune moment. Russia is a worthy partner that needs to be maintained."

 GER_expand_the_rhine_route:0 "Expand the Rhine Route"
 GER_expand_the_rhine_route_desc:0 "The Rhine is the most heavily used trade river in Europe and is the shared pride of the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, France and Switzerland. Germany and the Netherlands depend on each other to maximize the trade potential."
 GER_strengthen_ties_to_belgium:0 "Strengthen Ties to Belgium"
 GER_strengthen_ties_to_belgium_desc:0 "After closing the ranks with our Dutch neighbors, we need to also aggressively push our companies into the Belgian market. German influence on Belgium and Belgian dependence upon Germany will be essential for any future conflict between the two nations regarding the outdated nuclear power plant at Tihange, one of the primary threats to German national security."
 GER_trans_atlantic_trade:0 "Trans-Atlantic Trade"
 GER_trans_atlantic_trade_desc:0 "By investing in the "Deutsch-Amerikanische Handelskammern" ('German American Chambers of Commerce'), the German economy could increase its bilateral ties to the markets in the United States, particularly by tailoring high-end German goods to the needs of American industry. That would serve both the German role as an export nation and the American role as an import nation."
 GER_trade_with_canada:0 "Trade with Canada"
 GER_trade_with_canada_desc:0 "Canada holds several key strengths as a trade partner: Abundance of natural resources, a highly educated workforce, strong pre-existing ties to Europe - and a huge dependency on a single country that they'd like to diversify away from. We have to find the hidden gears that could get a German-Canadian trade deal to function."
 GER_schroeder_ii:0 "Schröder II"
 GER_schroeder_ii_desc:0 "After assuming a first term as chancellor in 1998, Schröder has won several resounding political victories. The CDU and FDP crises regarding Kohl and Möllermann, respectively, have greatly diminished the conservatives' chances to win the election. Schröder's run for reelection could however still need some campaign boosts - like declining to join American wars of aggression."
 GER_auffangbank_concept:0 "'Auffangbank' Concept"
 GER_auffangbank_concept_desc:0 "Inspired by American Resolution Trust Corporations, or RTCs, the Schröder administration has brianstormed the creation of a German 'bad bank'-esque financial institute to predict and avoid future financial crises. But that would never happen, now would it?"
 GER_homegrown_software:0 "Homegrown Software"
 GER_homegrown_software_desc:0 "With the 'Schulen ans Netz' program in full effect, the funds should now also be diverted towards German multimedia companies like Nuremberg-based SoftMaker to develop utility and office programs to dissuade American-made software at the workplace. The German government could also subsidize the acquisition of licenses for such programs to double the incentive."
 GER_agenda_2010:0 "Agenda 2010"
 GER_agenda_2010_desc:0 "Gerhard Schröder was always a moderate among the social democrats and thus advocated restraint with the budget. The 'Agenda 2010' is an ambitious project of budget cuts and bureaucratic reforms that will without a doubt draw heavy criticism from leftist groups and push the government towards the center - but it could be fantastic for economic progress."
 GER_sports_funding:0 "Sports Funding"
 GER_sports_funding_desc:0 "In German politics, it usually proves very effective to generate domestic profit as well as political capital by funding and supporting sporting projects, particularly football stadiums."
 GER_hartz_iv:0 "Hartz IV"
 GER_hartz_iv_desc:0 "The 'Commission for Modern Services at the Labor Market', called the 'Hartz Commission' for its leader Peter Hartz, had to develop a new concept for the service market, categorized as Hartz I through Hartz IV. Hartz IV in particular, the new ruling on unemployment benefits, stands heavily against classical social democratic values and will garner heavy criticism from traditional SPD voters."
 GER_sonderparteitag:0 "Sonderparteitag"
 GER_sonderparteitag_desc:0 "Since Lafontaine's withdrawal, Schröder's support among left-wing forces in Germany has been waning. Juggling the interests of employers and employees, of unions and corporations, of the economy and the working class has been controversial, to say the least. Gerhard Schröder, to save face, must now pass party leadership to fully focus on his office as Federal Chancellor."
 GER_vertrauensfrage:0 "Vertrauensfrage"
 GER_vertrauensfrage_desc:0 "Schröder has been unable to keep the Greens in line and his own SPD behind him. His primary way of enforcing his own policies has been to threaten his resignation and to thus threaten the remaining stability of the coalition. Now, with public support definitely gone, it is time to call a vote of confidence, a 'Vertrauensfrage'. Schröder fully intends to lose this vote and to call for immediate reelections."
 GER_schroeder_iii:0 "Schröder III"
 GER_schroeder_iii_desc:0 "The political power move has worked: Schröder secures his third term as Federal Chancellor and can now assemble a new coalition, either with the neoliberal FDP or the progressive Greens. Both the leftist PDS and the conservative CDU/CSU are unlikely to approve of this result and will continue hard-fought opposition to SPD policy."
 GER_gewerkschaftsgesetz:0 "Gewerkschaftsgesetz"
 GER_gewerkschaftsgesetz_desc:0 "The traditionally close relationship between the SPD and Germany's powerful labor unions will once more show itself with the passage of Schröder's Gewerkschaftsgesetz, a piece of legislation that will grant striking workers even greater autonomy and protection from the employer's attempts to cut strikes short. Critically, the law would pass almost all decisions as to strike ends to respective governments."
 GER_regions_of_innovation:0 "Regions of Innovation"
 GER_regions_of_innovation_desc:0 "Championed by the SPD electoral program of 2005, the Schröder government promised the reduction of bureaucracy and waiting periods as part of the 'Innovationsregionen' promise. These Regions of Innovation should greatly lessen the burden of daily life on the working class individual, even though a restriction of bureaucracy through spending cuts would likely bring conflict with the Greens."
 GER_trust_in_germany:0 "Trust in Germany"
 GER_trust_in_germany_desc:0 "The SPD aggressively led its reelection bid for Gerhard Schröder's third term as Federal Chancellor with the slogan "Vertrauen in Deutschland", 'Trust in Germany'. Playing to patriotic and communal feelings and connecting these energies with working class activism could be a real game winner for social democratic fervor - and for national unity against domestic and international obstacles."
 GER_further_union_reassurances:0 "Further Union Reassurances"
 GER_further_union_reassurances_desc:0 "After the successful passing of the Gewerkschaftsgesetz, the Schröder administration stands determined to forge a lasting and fruitful alliance with Germany's powerful labor unions, against international mega corporations and foreign investors."
 GER_anti_unemployment_efforts:0 "Anti-Unemployment Efforts"
 GER_anti_unemployment_efforts_desc:0 "Unemployment, "Arbeitslosigkeit" in German, is one of the primary antagonists that the social democrats of the SPD seek to fight against. Built on the 'Regions of Innovation' program, the SPD leadership has now put forward a wide range of 'employment guarantee' policies that could push down the unemployment by as much as half a percent of the German population."
 GER_pan_european_efforts:0 "Pan-European Efforts"
 GER_pan_european_efforts_desc:0 "Although Schröder's advances to establish a European Confederation under Franco-German leadership all but irritated Paris, with the reestablished and newly strengthened social democratic leadership, it must be seriously considered whether or not another advance on the European ideal would be out of the question."
 GER_close_ranks_with_the_international_unions:0 "Close Ranks with the International Unions"
 GER_close_ranks_with_the_international_unions_desc:0 "After reestablishing the labor unions as the dominant force in German public life, Germany needs to take a dominant stance in international labor organizations to enforce high-quality labor standards across Europe and then the world. As long as there are cheaper labor pools in the EU, the living standards of the German working class are threatened."

 GER_angela_merkel:0 "Angela Merkel"
 GER_angela_merkel_desc:0 "With the lost Vertrauensfrage, Schröder's political capital and reputation with the German people was totally depleted. It was relatively easy for the conservative CDU/CSU, the 'Union', to pick up the pieces and sweep the election. Helmut Kohl's personal protegé, Angela Merkel, will be the main beneficiary. She will be the eighth Federal Chancellor of the FRG and the first woman to fill that post."
 GER_energy_reform:0 "Energy Reform"
 GER_energy_reform_desc:0 "The conservative Union opposed the Red-Green 'Atomkonsens' of 2000, in which the government decided to gradually shift away from nuclear energy in favor of renewables. The Merkel team views this step as rushed and vows to use nuclear energy for a longer period of time - and it would take a natural disaster close to a vulnerable nuclear power plant to make them flip flop on that promise..."
 GER_gesundheitspraemie:0 "Gesundheitsprämie"
 GER_gesundheitspraemie_desc:0 "A constantly popular talking point for conservative movements is the bloated nature of the budget. The Union, keenly aware of the German people's satisfaction with the healthcare program, attempted to reform its government budgeting by introducing a new kind of health tax, the 'Gesundheitsprämie'. It seeks to decrease the costs of employers and reshift them to the people in need of the service."

 GER_seek_centrist_compromises: "Seek Centrist Compromises"
 GER_seek_centrist_compromises_desc:0 "In order to secure power after Angela Merkel's election, the CDU should seek to establish a "Grand Coalition" between the Union and the SPD, the two largest parties. This would double up to assure limited conservative policy making and to isolate Gerhard Schröder. Schröder had humiliated himself after the election defeat and Angela Merkel would be able to assume the chancellorship with a clean sheet."
 GER_token_atomausstieg:0 "Token Atomausstieg"
 GER_token_atomausstieg_desc:0 "The 2005 Campaign had seen a pro-nuclear CDU/CSU pitted against the anti-nuclear SPD. The energy question will have to be solved to an unsatisfactory end for both sides in the coalition negotiations: The CDU/CSU will agree to an exit out of nuclear energy (German: "Atomausstieg") in the distant future, but the SPD will agree to not seek to accelerate the process beyond the Union's wishes."

 GER_industrial_outsourcing:0 "Industrial Outsourcing"
 GER_industrial_outsourcing_desc:0 "The German industrial sector has been massively weakened by the growth of wages and the free movement of labor to less fortunate European markets like Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.

Germany, a service economy, has a workforce share of only about 2% in the primary sector. Currently, the CAP funds are too stacked towards the 'first pillar', the farmers that are already wealthy.

A politically somewhat unsuccessful term, it might be ideologically useful to position the Union as conservative hardliners."
 GER_military_spending_offensive:0 "Military Spending Offensive"
 GER_military_spending_offensive_desc:0 "Schröder's SPD was always very happy to cut defense spending, reasoning that the Cold War was over and that the money was more needed in the social safety net and the welfare state. The CDU/CSU was left concerned about reaching the 2%-goal provided by NATO to its member states, demanding that 2% of GDP should be in defense spending. Germany needs to hurry to meet that demand."

Prussia played a huge part in German history and its cultural association with German monarchism and militarism mark it as a nationalist relic of times gone by - a fervor that the government could play into by certain nostalgic acts rehabilitating the Prussian state."
