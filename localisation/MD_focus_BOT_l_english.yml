 BOT_model_student_of_africa: "Model Student of Africa"
 BOT_model_student_of_africa_desc: "Botswana is one of the highly developed countries in Africa. Ever since its independence, it has been a stable democracy and and has seen very little conflict. Boasting the highest human development index and the lowest perceived corruption in sub-Saharan Africa, Botswana is a shining light for the rest of Africa to follow.\n\n§RIf our §YCorruption Level§! is higher than §Y$widespread_corruption$§! we will lose this bonus!§!"
 BOT_kalahari_expansion: "Kalahari Desertification"
 BOT_kalahari_expansion_desc: "The Kalahari Desert in the Western part of Botswana covers a large area. Year after year, this desert expands more. As 95% of Botswana receives so little rainfall that it is not viable for agriculture, 71% of the country is being used for agricultural grazing and most people get their water from groundwater. The large cattle industry makes the desertification worse, though almost half of Botswanans get their income from it.\n\nWestern Botswana is also a home to many national parks (which make up 20% of the country's land area), the largest of which is the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, home to the San People and one of the largest diamond mines in Botswana.\n\n§YEvery year we will get an update on the desertification status of the Kalahari. The most likely option for it is to increase every year.\n\nWe can continue exploiting the already suffering Kalahari and the surroung Savannah and make the desertification worse, or we can try to take a conservationist approach to slow down or even reverse it.§!"
 BOT_house_of_chiefs: "House of Chiefs"
 BOT_house_of_chiefs_desc: "The House of Chiefs (Ntlo ya Dikgosi) is an advisory body of the Botswanan parliament. The House composes of the hereditary chiefs of Botswana's 8 principle tribes, 22 elected members and 5 chiefs nominated by the President. The House holds no political or executive power, however most bills and all constitutional changes have to be reviewed and discussed in the House before making to the National Assembly.

 BOT_ancestral_land_conflict: "Ancestral Land Conflict"
 BOT_ancestral_land_conflict_desc: "In the Central Kalahari Game Reserve live the hunter-gatherer San People (also known as Bushmen), one of the oldest cultures on Earth. There also live other first nations people there such as the Bakgalagadi (after whom the desert is named). The Game Reserve was originally created to protect both the wildlife and the way of life of the Bushmen.\n\nIn the 1970s, the government of Botswana claimed that the San were overhunting the animals, and the area being a nature reserve blocked the government from setting up services for the San (such as schools and hospitals). A relocation program started, which happened to coincide with a diamond vein found in the Game Reserve. In the 1990s, relocation efforts intensified as the Government started cutting access to services for the people living in the reserve.\n\nThe San People only make up a tiny fraction of our population, and as such have no real ways of opposing us. However, their treatment is a stain on our international image."
 BOT_BDP_stronghold: "£BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP Stronghold"
 BOT_BDP_stronghold_desc: "Ever since the creation of the country, the £BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP (Botswana Democratic Party) has been ruling the country. Election after election they have been the largest party, with their smallest vote share being 55%. They are a big tent party that mixes conservatism, liberalism and socialism. Their main power comes from their Setswana supporters, so many other tribes in the country end up feeling left out. It would take a big political scandal to break the BDP hold on power.\n\n§YAs long as the A-Team and Barata-Phati factions of the £BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP combined form the largest party, the £BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP will stay in power after elections.\n\nIf the £BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP becomes too strong, opposition parties will form into a single party, and any effects that would impact a single minor party will affect this new party.\n\nIf the £BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP popularity drops too low, the reformist wing of the party will form its own party.§!"
 BOT_zimbabwean_refugees: "Zimbabwean Refugees"
 BOT_zimbabwean_refugees_desc: "The economic situation in Zimbabwe is pushing thousands of people both legally and illegally across the border into Botswana. Approximately one third of the Zimbabweans are in the country illegally, and most people crossing the border are immediately deported back to Zimbabwe. However, the mass number of refugees does have its benefits; while most Batswana get their living from cattle, most Zimbabweans work in the mining and industrial sectors, making them a disproportionate part of the Botswanan skilled labour force."

 Botswana_pulse.1.t: "Kalahari Desert Expands"
 Botswana_pulse.1.d: "According last year's data, the Kalahari Desert has continued expanding. Several areas meant for grazing are now barren, multiple groundwater sources have dried up and wildlife has been cut down due to poaching. Allowing people to freely graze their cattle where they want, mineral exploitation of the region and ignoring poaching is bound to make the situation worse."
 Botswana_pulse.1.a: "Shame"
 Botswana_pulse.2.t: "Kalahari Desert Normal"
 Botswana_pulse.2.d: "According last year's data, the desertification situation in and around the Kalahari seems to be holding steady. It is however only a matter of time before it gets worse again. Allowing people to freely graze their cattle where they want, mineral exploitation of the region and ignoring poaching is bound to make the situation worse."
 Botswana_pulse.2.a: "We have been given more time"
 Botswana_pulse.3.t: "Kalahari Desert Retreats"
 Botswana_pulse.3.d: "According last year's data, vegetation has grown part into large areas of the Kalahari. Mimicking natural grazing patterns and combating poaching will allow the area to heal itself."

 BOT_develop_anti_poaching_tactics: "Develop Anti-Poaching Tactics"
 BOT_develop_anti_poaching_tactics_desc: "We don't need help from larger powers to train our military. We can use what we've learned from protecting wildlife into a military doctrine"
 BOT_indian_military_cooperation: "Indian Military Cooperation"
 BOT_indian_military_cooperation_desc: "We have recently officially opened an embassy in India. India is very interested in the continent and many Indians live in Africa. They would be the perfect partner for training our military"
 BOT_american_military_cooperation: "American Military Cooperation"

 BOT_chinese_military_cooperation: "Chinese Military Cooperation"
 BOT_chinese_military_cooperation_desc: "China is a relatively new member on the African continent, but they are more than eager to help us out. They would offer a new perspective on how to run our army"
 BOT_enlist_women: "Enlist Women"
 BOT_enlist_women_desc: "While Botswana is a very progressive and modern country, the Army does not accept women as recruits. This is something that should be fixed, and access to the military has been campaigned for the past 20 years by women's rights activist Ntombi Setshwaelo. It is time to allow Setswana women to serve the country"
 BOT_peacekeeping_army: "Focus on Peacekeeping"
 BOT_peacekeeping_army_desc: "The Botswanan Defence Forces have taken part in many international operations, such as Somalia and Lesotho. This is the area we should focus on, to make the world a better place, Of course, not all servicemen will be happy that their spill their blood mainly for other countries"
 BOT_anti_poaching_army: "Anti-Poaching Army"
 BOT_anti_poaching_army_desc: "One of our largest problems is the poaching that plagues the country. We should train our army to fight them and protect our wildlife. We should also train them in disaster relief for any natural disasters that might occur. Our soldiers will know the lay of the land much better, but as a professional fighting force their skills will be reduced"
 BOT_shift_to_traditional_military: "Shift to a Traditional Military"
 BOT_shift_to_traditional_military_desc: "Reducing the military capacity of our army to a mere expanded police force that fights poachers was a mistake. We need to roll back this transition and turn the army into something that ensures national security"
 BOT_buy_pilatus_pc9: "Pilatus PC-9 Acquisition"
 BOT_buy_pilatus_pc9_desc: "In order for us to better scout and spot poachers, we need suitable light aircraft for this role. The Swiss company Pilatus manufactures light turboprop planes that would be perfect. With them we can spot (and occasionally bomb) poachers"
 BOT_buy_hercules_c130: "Transport Fleet Expansion"

 BOT_buy_gunships: "Buy Gunships"
 BOT_buy_gunships_desc: "In order to support our army's future ground operations, we need localised air support. For this role, helicopter gunships are the best. Russia has a long history of supplying gunships to Africa, and the Mi-24 Hind definitely is a classic"
 BOT_zimbabwe_border_fence: "Zimbabwe Border Fence"
 BOT_zimbabwe_border_fence_desc: "We need to build an electric fence on the border with Zimbabwe to stop animal migration to control foot-and-mouth disease from spreading over from Zimbabwe. By coincidence, this will also prevent Zimbabwean refugees from crossing the border illegally."
 BOT_deploy_peacekeepers: "Deploy Peacekeepers to Zimbabwe"
 BOT_deploy_peacekeepers_desc: "The situation in neighbouring Zimbabwe is abysmal. People suffer under a dictatorial and corrupt regime. By pulling some strings we have connected to the Zimbabwean government, we might be able to quietly oust [ZIM.GetLeader] from power under the pretense of human rights abuses"

 BOT_topple_mugabe: "Topple [ZIM.GetLeader]"

 BOT_militarise_tribes_desc: "The job of the Defence Forces is to protect the whole country. However, local defence could be handled better if we allow the Dikgosi, the local chiefs, to recruit their own private militias that would serve as regional garrisons"
 BOT_unite_bushmen: "Unite the Bushmen"
 BOT_unite_bushmen_desc: "Our neighbour Namibia has a similar history with the San as we do. The San face discrimination, displacement and almost slavery-like conditions in Namibia. Hundreds of San have fled across the border into Botswana. We cannot allow the San people to suffer like we did"
