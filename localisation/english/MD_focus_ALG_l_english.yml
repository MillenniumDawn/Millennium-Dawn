At the same time, the government has secured alliances with other major parties, forming a political coalition to consolidate authority and present a united front.

For them, Sharia represents a higher law, uncorrupted by the greed of politicians, the betrayal of the Harkis, or the influence of foreign powers. This is not a war against the Algerian people, but against the corrupt officials and foreign-backed elites who have stolen their future.

While the intensity of fighting has decreased, tensions remain high, and the wounds are far from healed.\n\nWith the nation's future uncertain, competing forces now push in different directions. One path seeks national reconciliation and democratic reforms to unify the country. Another leans toward prolonging emergency rule, maintaining the current regime's grip on power. Yet a third whispers of continued war — of unfinished battles, radical promises, and those who refuse to lay down arms.\n\nThe road Algeria chooses next may shape its destiny for generations."

 nuclear_algeria.14.d: "The Algerian government has come forth with documents, photos, and other evidence proving that they currently possess the capability to produce nuclear weapons, if they don't already have them at hand. Our administration is quite perplexed by this move, as the world has speculated that the Algerians have been trying to produce nuclear weapons for some time now, with claims of this being denied by Algeria. However it is suspected that Algeria is doing this as a way to blackmail us and the rest of the world into giving them benefits that we otherwise would not grant them. Regardless, we will need to lift sanctions on them, and whether we do it on our own terms or theirs will still need to be decided."
 nuclear_algeria.14.a: "Fine, what do they want?"

 nuclear_algeria.21.a: "We will see"
 nuclear_algeria.22.t: "Algeria Offers Cheap Oil"
 nuclear_algeria.22.d: "Algeria has offered its oil to us at a discounted price. This is as a result of crippling sanctions placed upon them by Western powers, and their friends. This has crippled Algeria's economy, and as a result, they are forced to sell off their oil at a cheaper price."

 nuclear_algeria.26.d: "The United States has chosen that it wants to decrease the amount of sanctions they have put on our people. Whether they maintain this stance is something that we will have to wait and see."
 nuclear_algeria.26.a: "Good"
 nuclear_algeria.27.t: "Algeria Begins Acting Erratically"
 nuclear_algeria.27.d: "Algeria has once more began acting more like a pariah state instead of a civilized one. We must reconsider our stance on sanctions."

 ALG_constitution_1996: "1996 Constitution"
 ALG_constitution_1996_desc: "The revised 1996 Constitution was meant to stabilize Algeria after the turmoil of the Black Decade. However, many provisions were designed with regime survival in mind, rather than genuine democratization. Its rigid secular framework was seen by large parts of the Islamist movement as illegitimate and 'un-Islamic.' While it consolidates state control and strengthens the presidency, it also restricts political participation, reduces trust between the government and society, and hinders long-term reform. The legacy of this constitution continues to weigh heavily on Algeria’s stability and legitimacy."

 ALG_new_constitution_desc:0 "The outdated 1996 Constitution has been amended to reflect a more balanced and democratic Algeria. While still imperfect, the reforms strengthen institutions, encourage reconciliation between Islamists and secularists, and open space for social and economic progress. Its success will depend on how faithfully it is implemented."
 alg_constitution.1.t:0 "The Constitution is Reformed"
 alg_constitution.1.d:0 "After years of controversy, the 1996 Constitution has been revised. The new framework removes some of the most authoritarian provisions, introduces checks on executive power, and seeks to create a better balance between Algeria’s Islamic and secular currents. Many view this as a necessary step towards reconciliation, while others doubt whether the reforms will truly change the entrenched system of le pouvoir."

 ALG_ali_belhadj_desc:0 "Ali Belhadj, co-founder of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), was one of the most charismatic and radical Islamist leaders of Algeria’s turbulent 1990s. Known for his fiery sermons, uncompromising rhetoric, and rejection of secular politics, he became a symbol of resistance to the FLN regime. Imprisoned for much of the civil war and banned from formal politics under the 1996 Constitution, Belhadj remains a polarizing figure — for some, the embodiment of Islamist grievance; for others, a dangerous reminder of the Black Decade. His potential return to the political stage raises both hopes of reconciliation and fears of renewed extremism."
 ALG_bouamrane_desc:0 "Mohamed Bouamrane emerged in the 1990s as a more moderate Islamist intellectual and political actor. Advocating dialogue over confrontation, he positioned himself between hardline Islamists like Ali Belhadj and the entrenched FLN elite. While never achieving the same mass appeal as the FIS leadership, Bouamrane became a respected figure in post-war debates on reconciliation and constitutional reform. His vision emphasized an Algeria where Islamic values could coexist with democratic institutions, making him a bridge figure in the tense balance between secular and religious politics."
