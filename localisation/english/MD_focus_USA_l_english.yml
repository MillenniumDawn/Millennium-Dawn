 ##US Army Branch Tree ##
 USA_focus_united_states_army: "United States Army"
 USA_focus_united_states_army_desc: "Founded as the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, the United States Army is one of the three main pillars of the armed forces of these United States. Throughout its history the army has seen countless tones of innovation as well as its fair share of corruption. But in the modern age the branch faces a new challenge. With the peak of technological innovations on the rise the divide between tech vs tact is ever growing into destructive means. Lost money, R&D projects going over budget by metrics not seen in decades as well as just the internal sabotage of fellow officers and generals means there is much to do. The question is, where to start?"
 USA_focus_five_star_folly: "The Five Star Folly"
 USA_focus_five_star_folly_desc: "The modern battlefield is one of both will and determination, not gizmos and gadgets. We must therefore fine tune and retool our training efforts, our structure and the adaptability of our forces with the equipment for which we already have. R&D will be cut and religated to quality of life improvements, small arms enhancements, as well as logistical prowess."
 USA_focus_infantry_doctrine_debate: "Infantry Doctrine Debate"
 USA_focus_infantry_doctrine_debate_desc: "In order to be efficient as well as cut costs, we must look into the core of what makes our army function. This core pillar is that of the common soldier, the infantry. Currently there are three main doctrines which pressed on through and past the Cold Wars' conclusion. The Light Infantry Doctrine, the Mobile Infantry Doctrine and the Armored Infantry Doctrine. These three have their ups and downs, but the question is, which one suits our nation the best in terms of economy and flexibility."
 USA_focus_light_infantry_dominance: "Light Infantry Dominance"
 USA_focus_light_infantry_dominance_desc: "The foot soldier is the easiest one to mold and adapt to any situation. With this key we shall turn the lock and open the door to efficiency, letting our soldiers be able to handle threats, both on land or in the air."
 USA_focus_mobile_infantry_machine: "Mobile Infantry Machine"
 USA_focus_mobile_infantry_machine_desc: "Through the flexibility of the foot soldier, combined with the mobility of motorized transports and recon type vehicles, we strive to create the ultimate strike force that is the core of our army."
 USA_focus_armored_infantry_ascendance: "Armored Infantry Ascendance"
 USA_focus_armored_infantry_ascendance_desc: "Modern tanks are expensive and very costly for the potential \"reward\" they give. Therefore we must adapt our infantry to replace and stand in for these money sinks and create a new way forward. The armored infantry doctrine will secure versatility of armored combat, with the more efficient and flexible deployment of foot soldiers to take attention away and confuse both enemy armored and light force elements."
 USA_focus_tank_force_dilemma: "Tank Force Dilemma"
 USA_focus_tank_force_dilemma_desc: "The modern battlefield has nearly made the original use of the tank, obsolete. We must seriously consider what we intend to make use of these massive metal machines if we are to genuinely have a well rounded army."
 USA_focus_repurposing_armored_programs: "Repurposing Armored Programs"
 USA_focus_repurposing_armored_programs_desc: "The RAP directive is an immediate reorganization of the army. Tank forces will be nearly stopped and reserved for very specific duties if need be, however the main directive will be that the research and materials will be redirected towards IFV, APC and other programs to bolster and improve all other aspect of combat."
 USA_focus_modern_tanks_modern_solutions: "Modern Tanks, Means Modern Solutions"
 USA_focus_modern_tanks_modern_solutions_desc: "The tank is a modern marvel and should not be simply discarded as a gimmick of a bygone era.

 USA_focus_logistical_dominance: "Logistical Dominance"
 USA_focus_logistical_dominance_desc: "The army functions only when it actually has the equipment essential to maintain a combat effective force. We must therefore set an example by encouraging and expanding the logistical apparatus to ensure the timely and efficient conduct of our supply and logistical network."
 USA_focus_fire_support_supremacy: "Fire Support Supremacy"
 USA_focus_fire_support_supremacy_desc: "Artillery, the king of the battlefield. Mobility is versatile to one's designing needs, area clearing is effective in multiple ways and as an addd bonus, can be relatively cheaper than calling in for a plane. As such we will invest and ensure our artillery is marked to be the new age bread winner of war, just like it was decades and even centuries before."
 USA_focus_gold_star_program: "Gold Star Program"
 USA_focus_gold_star_program_desc: "The modern battlefield is defined by the technological edge of our enemies. Though the arms race that was the Cold War is over, our enemies continue to grow day by day, as the \"Era of Peace\" continues to bubble and churn its way into a boiling hot stew of discontent, revolutions and social unrest. We must invest heavily in R&D programs, refine our technological integrations and ensure that we are not only army strong, but an army of one."
 USA_focus_armored_combat_debate: "Armored Combat Debate"
 USA_focus_armored_combat_debate_desc: "The modern queen of the battlefield is that of the armored fighting vehicle. Be it tanks, IFVs or APCs, these war machines can define a single battle and potentially even an entire campaign. However, as innovations in armored combat are made we have come into a split in the road. Do we focus more on tank based developments or do we reserve more for the lighter infantry support vehicles like IFVs and APCs."
 USA_focus_light_vehicle_innovations: "Light Vehicle Innovations"
 USA_focus_light_vehicle_innovations_desc: "While tanks are good at being mobile bunkers, the investments and innovations in modern AT capabilities makes direct tank combat a more risky investment in both material and personnel. Therefore we can redirect funding more towards APCs and IFVs to ensure a flexible infantry and armored approach. Besides APCs and IFVs are a lot easier to make modular then tanks are."
 USA_focus_modern_battle_tank_innovations: "Modern Battle Tank Innovations"
 USA_focus_modern_battle_tank_innovations_desc: "The MBT or Modern Battle Tank is a Cold War innovation that has created the modern standard of tank doctrine. We must utilize this and ensure we create a powerful armored force to punch and steel ourselves against any enemy attacks. As a byproduct of such innovations, units like SPAA and SPGs are likely to see passive innovations as we retool unit organizations to encompass more equal footing sub units."
 USA_focus_mass_motorization_efforts: "Mass Motorization Efforts"
 USA_focus_mass_motorization_efforts_desc: "To ensure our mobility to any metric we've chosen, we must compel our manufacturing partners to standardize and increase motorization production as to allow for our infantry to keep pace with our mechanized and armored elements."

This being the artillery and its crew. We need to figure out just what direction we need to take it and if we are to focus more on defense or potential offense to prevent the enemy from just casually striking on these glaring targets. "
 USA_focus_defensive_artillery_program: "Defensive Artillery Program"
 USA_focus_defensive_artillery_program_desc: "The DAP initiative is a program designed to research and innovate towards better defensive measures in both design of equipment as well as its ability to be defended in the field as a whole.

 USA_focus_offensive_artillery_program: "Offensive Artillery Program"
 USA_focus_offensive_artillery_program_desc: "The OAP is to set a new standard of maneuver warfare for the entire force. Through innovations and research related to armor and Self Propelled Artillery systems, we set the pace of our entire army as the artillery is considered the slowest unit within the branch."
 USA_focus_supplies_supples_supplies: "Supplies, Supplies, Supplies"
 USA_focus_supplies_supples_supplies_desc: "The quartermaster corps is gearing up to be the backbone of the army's functionality. More advancements and complex weapons systems means more things to lug around and worry about replacing when in the field.

 USA_focus_united_states_navy_desc: "Founded in 1776, disbanded after the revolution and then refounded as an emergency reaction to the Barbary Pirates of the time in the 1800s, the United States Navy has had a stoic and ever changing history. Being the forefront of innovations navally since over taking the British Empire around the time of the world wars, the US navy seeks to figure out just what it needs in the new millennia. With most combat being land or air centric, many in the public wonder just how much money does the navy needs. As such naval leadership needs to pivot its thinking and PR teams to justify any new decisions, for if the navy is to be more than a simple merchant defense fleet, then it must find its new voice in this new age."
 USA_focus_project_steel_waves: "Project Steel Waves"
 USA_focus_project_steel_waves_desc: "We are the superpower of the globe, not a badge of honor, not a demerit of shame, simply a status of order and position. To this avail we must adapt our naval reach to fit this status. Most global powers combined can't fully compete with our tech from nearly 40+ years ago and as such we will keep the R&D focused around streamlining production, repairs and modifications of existing ships. A modular and adaptive fleet of many, rather than a slowly shrinking fleet of raw tech and power."

Whichever it is we need to figure it out and begin working on it like it was yesterday."
 USA_focus_mobile_airports_program: "Mobile Airports Program"
 USA_focus_mobile_airports_program_desc: "Through R&D in making more nimble aircraft as well as both lauch and landing assist systems, we can look to make our carriers into mobile airports.

In the modern age of isolated campaigns and no \"grand war\" with a foe that can be easily identified, the identity of the modern marine is a bit different. We need to figure out if we should continue to have a specialized Marine Corps or institute a more support and or generalization of the branch and move it towards the army, rather than a sub-department strictly under the navy."

On both sides we have a PR nightmare and the increased likelihood of a further breakdown in the social order and trust in our system. As such we must envoke the Presidential Succession Act and do something completely unprecedented. Skip the House and Senate and inaugurate the current Secretary of State. A safe choice for us and a national first as in this nation's history never have we exprienced something so sharp pierce the very heart and foundation of our nation.....

Eventually the government figured this out and fixed it mostly but running hidden initiatives to get the nation to consume more dairy products. However the surplus was so huge that another initiative was started known as \"Government Cheese\". This simple program has left an imprint on the older generations and most new generations will never know that time you could get cheap to free cheese. But not any more. It costs way more to store these stockpiles then it does to give back and as such the program is being restarted. More food on peoples' tables means less worry of health concerns in certain areas as well as the need for certain welfare programs, in addition we lower the stockpiles and then we lower the cost to the government for storage.

 ##Democratic Socialist Party Tree
 USA_demsoc_victory: "Victory Of The Red Democracy Party"
 USA_demsoc_victory_desc: "Since the fall of the duopoly from public favor, many of the people aligning with Democratic Socialist movements in Europe and so forth split from the party of the Elephant and moved to create a new party. This new party would follow a lot of trends in policy decisions as their European counterparts. The Red Democracy Party is the bridge between the social and economic gaps which the old party has created. For now our Robins fly forward to a new dawn of change."
 USA_reduce_corporate_power: "Reduce Corporate Power"
 USA_reduce_corporate_power_desc: "This nation is a corporatist nation without anyone really wanting to believe it. We must strip these top down influences on our very democracy by stripping away lobbying organized groups and the large threshold of money dumping on complicit and weak minded politicians as a whole. We'll face a hard time in congress but in the end it will be worth it."
 USA_increasing_working_class_power: "Increase Working Class Power"
 USA_increasing_working_class_power_desc: "The majority of this nations' people believe they don't have a voice. This has caused an apathy crisis which previous administrations have capitalized on to hold their power. Through awareness campaigns, grass roots movements and strategic national holidays we can give the people the time they need, the voice they want and of course the motivation they deserve. In a democracy, voting is force itself, the supreme authority which is exercised against the realities of human weakness in character and care for its fellow members."
 USA_state_interventionism: "State Interventionism"
 USA_state_interventionism_desc: "Corporate greed and selfishness as a whole can stifle real development and progress. With this in mind we will introduce legislation to allow limited and targeted areas where the federal government can fully intervene if the need arises. We'll get some push back but nothing we can't over come."
 USA_welfare_state: "The Welfare State"
 USA_welfare_state_desc: "While welfare programs are neither a left or right concept, being it is just the care for those in the nation who have done their part.

 USA_public_ownership: "Public Ownership"
 USA_public_ownership_desc: "The Public Ownership Board will be a governmental committee on public based entities be they directly or indirectly controlled by the government. This is including state and federal levels which will each have their own sub-committee to allow for fluid focus and the cohesion of being under the same umbrella."
 USA_defunding_militarism: "Defunding Militarism"
 USA_defunding_militarism_desc: "The hyper militaristic past of our nation has slowly softened as people finally come to terms that we are not in the Cold War anymore. We will strike at the heart of this by directly deploying the US Corps of Engineers to peace time developments and incentivize the civilian based economy over the military one."
 USA_planned_economy: "Planning The Economy"
 USA_planned_economy_desc: "We will begin limited government plans for the economic growth to support the public sector.

 USA_rebuilding_the_democratic_system_desc: "We must look to fundamentally rebuild our democracy. We must focus on our internal security and the integrity of our nation and its political apparatus.

 USA_equal_opportunity_for_all_desc: "The people of this nation only know of the oppressive past. But we can show and lead them to a free spirited future. Enforcement of equality must take precedent in this modern age of hidden agendas and hatred."

 USA_pricing_mechanisms_desc: "We have seen in these past decade or so that the nation suffers critically by selfish people like land lords. Now while we can't just stop the concept of land lords right this moment, we can look to stop the increasing severity of the situation. With targeted price fixings we can devalue the commodification of things which are needed for survival itself. We can use this as a stepping stone for the future."
 USA_consumer_production: "Consumer Focused Production"
 USA_consumer_production_desc: "With the US lacking in competitiveness on the global stage its high time we rectify this.

 USA_small_business_commission: "Small Business Commission"

 USA_robincare_act: "The Robincare Act"
 USA_robincare_act_desc: "Congressional lawmakers have decided to pass a bill wherein the care that companies provide will be more wide ranged in overall regards.

 USA_private_ownership_act: "Private Ownership Act"
 USA_private_ownership_act_desc: "The oxymoron that is the Private Ownership Act is one which will change the economic precedent of the nation. Private ownership can be established but nevertheless it will be subject to federal standings, if said standings are ignored and willfully disregarded the SBC and other affiliated agencies can come in and change leadership and at worst clean house all together. This will ensure the needs of the common workers and the unions which form the foundation of any workers rights movement."

 USA_department_of_economic_management_desc: "The DoEM will be a government oversight department in helping to understand, regulate and look to implement true public ownership into our Socialist society. Now while we preach the words of Marx, we also look to those more well rounded in their thinking. We look to Robert Owens and his ethical Socialism, or as marx himself called it \"Utopian\" Socialism. But we look for inspiration from the Market Socialist as well, we will decommoditize housing and slowly understand the true basic needs of the modern people. From there we will reform the markets of the wants for those who can earn and of course make it."
 USA_national_unions_act: "The National Unions Act"
 USA_national_unions_act_desc: "The unions of the nation are scattered among their own infighting. We must unite them under a national entity, we must seek out the rabblerousers within these smaller unions, crush them, and unite them under the common national goal. The public demands a united front, we must not fight with the splinters of pendantic reasoning. We must be a new Socialist society, one which focuses on the public, their needs and the ability to create a unity in belief and understanding of cause."
 USA_political_science_reforms: "Political Science Reforms"
 USA_political_science_reforms_desc: "The ideas of politics and ideology are so confused in this supposed \"post truth\" era we live in that we must set a real standard of rationality and reason. Our scientific community with help through state mandated funding will be used to create templates of approaching sensitive subjects. The conscept of an ideology for example, an ideology is a well rounded set of beliefs stretching from both economic and social backgrounds. With this we can tell that ideologies are not left or right, but rather subjective to the individuals combined beliefs. As such the old distinction of left and right, one which was originally used to determine ones standing on economics is completely defunct in this new age of cutural and societal change as a whole. Technology in itself is a big fault for the confusion and as such we must help to better research, understand and implement new discoveries as a whole."
 USA_department_of_state_security: "Department Of State Security"
 USA_department_of_state_security_desc: "The DoSS will be a joint federal oversight commission which will unite the different state security branches we have within the nation. These different branches all have their own goals and fight with each other over the importance of either domestic or foreign happenings. We must put an end to this factionalism and have a united policy in approaching both sides of this coin. Formost to defend the public we must focus on the domestic issues, but to strengthen our domestic approach is to understand foreign incursions against us. We must defend our society from those who wish to strip it limb by limb from us."

 USA_socialist_militarism_desc: "The militarism of the nation has always been used for imperialist reasoning. Exploiting nations for their resources by using our military in either direct means like in iraq, or by indirect means through our extensive military base apparatus is what makes the world hate us. We must slowly decommission and retrain the modern soldier. One who understands the true values that they serve the public, the cause of Socialism, the cause of a just, fairer world.

Its this same hubris which cost the Soviets to lose the Polish Soviet War of 1921. We must create targeted language to issues that matter to them, specifically funding in security measures to boost our foreign presence. While this may not help domestically, it will make our mark on the world."
 USA_appeasing_the_anarchist_society: "Appeasing The Anarchist Society"
 USA_appeasing_the_anarchist_society_desc: "The Anarchist Society is a strong wing of the Socialist coalition party we hold onto.

Protectionism gives people the notion they can still trade and exploit us, however we know better. Our Anarchist economics will ensure that domestic supply chains are met by domestic means.

 USA_the_communes_act: "The Communes Act"
 USA_the_communes_act_desc: "The Communes Act is legislation set forth to spread out and decentralize the urban centers. This will be a slow process, but the idea is to, in a way, slowly de-industrialize and return people to the vast lands which we have as a nation. These new communes can work in conjunction with already established townships and villages near their area. This will reduce the government oversight of needed services which weakens the hold the government has as well, while still stregthening the domestic defense ideal of the nation."

As such we must gear our nation and its people to defend their families and homes from anyone who wishes to make that fateful decision."
 USA_american_aas_hybrid_economics: "Hybrid Economics"
 USA_american_aas_hybrid_economics_desc: "With the changing winds we seek to encourage our citizenry to be prepared for survival. As such civilian manufacturies and other businesses must have a small percentage dedicated to military production. This way we bolster local defenses as well as ensure the ease of readiness if a foreign power should try to seize our land and people."
 USA_american_aas_decentralizing_corporate_entities: "Decentralizing Corporate Entities"
 USA_american_aas_decentralizing_corporate_entities_desc: "The soft power influences of modern economics is the scariest thing to a stable society. With foreign governments looking to use the soft power to bypass the use of force. This underhanded approach has resulted in us forcing our hand in the fact that we have been forced to speed up our decentralization of corporate type entities. In an extreme form of anti-monopoly enforcement, the cases brought forth will break up and even our the excessive market shares held by these titans of modern industries."
 USA_american_aas_reactive_autarky: "Reactive Autarky"
 USA_american_aas_reactive_autarky_desc: "Foreign trade is nearing non-existent levels due to the percieved threat we supposedly are to other national governments. With this in mind we must encourage local mining operations and do what we can to encourage the citizenry to understand the need to be self sufficient."
 USA_american_aas_militarization_debate: "The Militarization Debate"
 USA_american_aas_militarization_debate_desc: "The question of militarization is the biggest upset in our society. Many principled anarchist already are abhorrent to our mere existence cause of the paradox we preserve in the form of a \"state\". Nevertheless a good majority of the population is wondering and rightly worried about our preservation in living in such a free society. Therefore we must make a genuine discussion and come to a real agreement on what to do about the military force our nation will have."
 USA_american_aas_the_survival_answer: "The Survival Answer"
 USA_american_aas_the_survival_answer_desc: "The preservation of our nation is a must, we will ensure our defense is paramount and the top priority above all. As such R&D efforts, training and production will be geared to making sure we are the toughest nut to crack. There will be those who will cry for our supposed \"abdication\", for the throne of power we are supposedly creating. But the people will agree with us that defending our homes is the biggest principle to follow than some political arbitrary points."
 USA_american_aas_the_principle_answer: "The Principle Answer"
 USA_american_aas_the_principle_answer_desc: "Our actions will shout out our intentions, we don't need militarization to keep ourselves under the thumb of power hungry folks to preserve our nation's safety. As such we will continue with our hybrid economics and look to more well roundedly respond to the needs of our people and whatever threats theoretically could arise."
 USA_american_aas_the_volunteers_program: "The Volunteers Program"
 USA_american_aas_the_volunteers_program_desc: "Fundamentally speaking we can't conscript, we'd lose our anarchist title by exerting that kind of force. But if we create incentive programs and adapt them we could bring in more volunteers passively. It'll cost us budgetary wise but its worth the defense of the nation"
 USA_american_aas_air_over_navy: "Air Over Navy"
 USA_american_aas_air_over_navy_desc: "We don't plan on traveling half way across the world any more for pointless wars and god knows what else the old order was doing. So with so much naval excess we can actually break down, scrap, repurpose and so much more into the air force. This saves our budget from increasing and ironically would decrease it in other regards as well. This will allow us to give even more back to the people which in turn would bolster our support."
 USA_american_aas_retooling_public_support: "Retooling Public Support"
 USA_american_aas_retooling_public_support_desc: "Speeches, signs and the realities is what we can do and what we will use to ensure the support of the people to shift their thinking to be more military oriented. This process will be slow and will likely hurt us cohesion wise. However we must let the people know of the real threat that some foreign governments perceive us as and the high possibility of a foreign attack on our collective."
 USA_american_aas_every_soldier_a_pathfinder: "Every Soldier A Path Finder"
 USA_american_aas_every_soldier_a_pathfinder_desc: "As we \"recruit\" more and more people we gain a wealth of passive experiences along the way. This experience is not that of any war college could teach, but rather the natural exposure that these folks have in terms of navigation of their local region. As such every soldier in our collective will be asked to hone in on these skills and teach and help those who are not that good or who are not familiar with the area in which they may operate. This will boost our cohesion as well as our ability to do defensive and if need be offensive actions to reclaim any lost territory the enemy force may covet."
 USA_american_aas_the_free_citizen_army: "The Free Citizen Army"
 USA_american_aas_the_free_citizen_army_desc: "We must seek out a collective identity for our military if we are to keep cohesion as well as support. Rally by the cause and the black flag, for the FCA will defend home and family from the enemies for which decide to step foot on our freedom."
 USA_american_aas_american_culture_is_anarchism: "American Culture Is Anarchism"
 USA_american_aas_american_culture_is_anarchism_desc: "The American way as some say is taking the definition of minarchism and then putting a weapon in every citizen's hands and saying, \"You defend what's yours so the government nor other power cannot take it from you\". This paramount individualism around the family or locality like a town is very in line with Anarchism and its collectivism through communes. All's we have to do is just change up some words and phrasing and every citizen will be honored to defend their home from invaders."
 USA_american_aas_butter_bread_ammo_lead: "Butter, Bread, Ammo & Lead"
 USA_american_aas_butter_bread_ammo_lead_desc: "Without food and army stops, without ammo and army stops functioning. Both sides of the economic spectrum are in fact literally the same coin. As such we will ensure the economy and the people are encouraged to defend as well as feed their own. Peace, Land and Bread will be ours."
 USA_american_aas_the_village_model: "The Village Model"
 USA_american_aas_the_village_model_desc: "Moving more in line economically towards Anarchism, we'll incentivize and allow communities and villages to be created where ever there is vacant land and the people who settle those lands will be able to create and provide what they want and what they can to defend their homes and new found lands."
 USA_american_aas_militia_system: "The Militia System"
 USA_american_aas_militia_system_desc: "The militia system is one seen used more frequently to a whole spectrum of resutls. Some militias self harden and become practically their own armies. Other militias practically are cannon fodder or even just target practice for the opposition, we will have results and we will preserve our ability to defend. The American culture of gun ownership, the free will to defend one's home and family will be used as a keystone of training and organization of military units for our Free Army. Orders will be explained to ensure that questions about them are minimal and arguments about the justness of the order is to as small of a degree as possible. Officer's will be voted for but the voting will be done according to the military aptitude of the person wanting to be voted in. This will disuade the popularity contest that voting can divulge into and hopefully allow for our military to function as intended."
 USA_american_aas_the_new_agrarianism: "The New Agrarianism"
 USA_american_aas_the_new_agrarianism_desc: "Food security, this is the reality which can make or break any of these governments. As such we should look to secure not only our own food, but the political sway that any excess food may have as a form of incentive to leave us be."
 USA_american_aas_de_corporatization: "De-Corporatization"
 USA_american_aas_de_corporatization_desc: "In retooling our economy, we will focus heavily on decentralization through decorporatization. In doing this we give all power back to the individual, small communities and the back bone of any economy which is the mom & pop shop. We will make a new way forward together, for we are united in living, not divided by excesses of greed and \"wealth\"."
 USA_american_aas_mutual_agreements_diplomacy: "Mutual Agreements Diplomacy"
 USA_american_aas_mutual_agreements_diplomacy_desc: "With the massive shift in our economic power and our prioritization of decentralization, specialization and agrarianism, many in the world have understood that maybe, just maybe we can work with these \"Anarchists\". Therefore our diplomatic strategy moving forward is assuances related to mutual agreements. Trade deals and the like will be conducted in a manner which is seen as fair as possible for the mutual benefit for not only our society, but for the foreign societies which still are wary of our existence. It's not much, but its a continued step in the direction of self security."
 USA_american_aas_the_societal_betterment_fund: "The Societal Betterment Fund"
 USA_american_aas_the_societal_betterment_fund_desc: "Reorganization of the oppressive tax system is a chore in its own right. Everyone knows that expenditures for the well being of the society, through social, health and economic or infrastructure programs allows for the cohesive growth and sustainment of a modern society. However if we are to model something like that, we must approach it with a metric that makes sense within the confines of our society. If not we could expect civil disorder cause we are \"stealing\", the labor and wealth of the people and that would never do. As such we will organize the \"Tax collection\" like a donation drive. Explaining the programs we could fund and giving roadmaps and outlines of where specifically their money will go to in terms of the society, rather than just to the pockets of the few."
 USA_american_aas_defense_industry_council: "Defense Industry Council"
 USA_american_aas_defense_industry_council_desc: "A military force is not needed until it sudden is. Acts of aggression never are intended to make sense since the aggression is against our own species. However history of our species shows some limited form of a military is needed, with this in mind our focus is purely and ethusiastically defensive oriented. A defense industry council will be elected by voted local representatives to help establish and standardize the production of any kind of war related to ensure our safety from unwarranted aggression is a certainty."
 USA_american_aas_the_societys_needs: "The Society's Needs"
 USA_american_aas_the_societys_needs_desc: "Defunding the central authority is paramount and returning the wealth and labor of the citizens is the pillar of anarchism. We will work to give back truly to the society for the society itself knows what it needs."
 USA_american_aas_the_minuteman_example: "The Minute Man Example"
 USA_american_aas_the_minuteman_example_desc: "The minute men of old are what our society should've been. Regardless these stalwarks of individualism and courage to defend their families and homes is exactly what we will inspire and encourage our society to become. For we defend what is ours and we defend our right to self determination."
 USA_american_aas_gutting_government: "Gutting Government"
 USA_american_aas_gutting_government_desc: "To ensure a safe society, we must do what we can to gut the governmental bloat and excess. Things that would seem \"normal\" and required are not so in a society not trifled with the globalistic idealism of old. Now we do limited negotiations with whoever approaches us as well as we focus near entirely on our society and its needs."
 USA_american_aas_local_teachings_for_local_needs: "Local Teachings For Local Needs"
 USA_american_aas_local_teachings_for_local_needs_desc: "With us gutting the government, the next step is that of the government telling us what we can and can't teach our kids. This would obviously hurt centralized research efforts, but the prioritization of the welfare as well as the ensurance of survival of everyone is what should be the primary teachings of life itself."
 USA_american_aas_the_new_society: "The New Society"
 USA_american_aas_the_new_society_desc: "We have created a truly blessed and better society. Where the people can act as according their needs rather than the ever growing wants that modern globalism and consumerism has drilled into our minds. Now we set forth to our biggest goal ever. To proclaim our new society."
 USA_american_aas_the_free_american_territories: "Proclaim The Free Territories"
 USA_american_aas_the_free_american_territories_desc: "These once united states have now through trials and error, through unity beyond that needed for a state, have now formed a new path. We now can proudly proclaim our collective movement as the Free Territories of America. Now each and every person within these lands can enjoy their home, their family and their own lives without outside interference by governments and bad parties. Solidarity will be ours Forever."

 ##Domestic Policies
 USA_decisions_domestic_policies: "Domestic Policies"
 USA_decisions_domestic_policies_desc: "The United States has a long checkered history of \"handling\", its domestic issues. While many just see this as the run of the mill congress circus, others worry that as topics become more emotional and exploitative via demagouges and media companies that it could lead to a sort of crisis flash point. Nevertheless there are topics to discuss and make decisions on. So get ready to debate."

 #List of Decisions
 USA_decision_post_nine_eleven_response: "Post 9/11 Response"
 USA_decision_post_nine_eleven_response_desc: "In the following days of the attacks which devestated our nation, we must seek out what is the correct course of action in our response. For we shall set a precedent to those who wish to do such acts of terrorism in this world and what kind of response they can expect."
 USA_decision_post_nine_eleven_security_concerns: "Post 9/11 Security Concerns"
 USA_decision_post_nine_eleven_security_concerns_desc: "Our security in terms of air travel as well as our nation has been lax ever since the Soviet Union fell. But this rude and sobering awakening has renewed talks about how to better ensure the security and safety of our nation at large."
 USA_decision_religious_freedoms_debate: "Religious Freedoms Debate"
 USA_decision_religious_freedoms_debate_desc: "With the terrorist attacks being perpetrated by a zealous religious sect, many agnostics and atheist are coming out and putting their two cents about what should and shouldn't be free to do religiously. This debate is very sensitive and some belive they are conflating individual actions to whole groups."
 USA_decision_school_choice_dilemma: "The School Choice Dilemma"
 USA_decision_school_choice_dilemma_desc: "Ever since the formalizing of the Department of Education and the federal education system, states themselves have always been pushing back against what some call government oversight. Nevertheless a perpetual debate over the ability to have school choice, where parents can choose to either send their kids to a private scetor based school or a public sector school has always been a sensitive topic to say the least.

But guess what, the state of Texas itself has its own power grid. This whole arrangement has brought critics all around to the debate table as the organization and infrastructure which make up all these grid networks is appalling at best and a disaster waiting to happen at worst.

 USA_decision_the_job_impact_scare_desc: "With the recent rumblings about a \"Green Economy\" buzzing about many people are being lulled into a sense of fear due to how drastically this kind of change could have on many jobs. Similar to the automation and AI scares, many wonder how many jobs and skill sets will be nullified or made redundant of such changes.

 USA_decision_the_social_impact_desc: "The \"Green Economy\" will have an interesting social impact as many advocate for standardizing and forced modernization of housing both new and old. Some argue this would break many home owners and be the biggest mistake of governmental regulation since the government inaction which resulted in the Penn Central Railroad Bankruptcy back in the 1970s. others say it will be something that can be rolled out with new houses though there are concerns of the culture shock this may have on our ever aging population demographics.

The distrust has lead to an ever increasing factional state within the supposed two party system, which has begun to lead some to more and more extreme views at the expense of rationality and pragmatism towards the real issues. Many are beginning to call this America's 2nd Gilded Age."

 us_economic_policies: "American Economic Policies"
 us_economic_policies_desc: "Since the dawn of the nation and its congressional bodies creation there has always been an affect that the bills and legislations of these institutions have on the nation as a whole. While some say their views are right and others argue against saying no its their views which are right. The reality is there is no real or earnestly clear answer. The complexities of such a geographically and demographically diverse nation will always create pitfalls and horizons for many. The best one can hope is that the stauch \"my way\" based \"solutions\" end up helping more than they hurt. Despite the last administration's budget surplus many still see the ballooning spending rates in healthcare, the rising welfare spending and so on as a growing concern along with economic volatility creating uncertainty in the dollar's value itself. If congress can't get the deficit spending under control there may be turbulent times ahead. Alas only time and congress shall be able to tell that."

However it is the sub-department of the DotI known as the Department of Natural Resources that tends to be on a lot of people's shit list to say the least. However the Department of the Interior has a job to do and for the msot part they do actually do it, to the dislike of many. Now as a new millennia is upon us the department must find new ways to balance social developments and land preservation in this ever changing world."
 USA_dynamic_modifier_department_of_energy: "US Department Of Energy"
 USA_dynamic_modifier_department_of_energy_desc: "The DoE or Department of Energy is a very fickled department.

Regardless with modern technology and a new green wave of energy production abilities the department may just find a way to keep things afloat for the foreseeable future."
 USA_domestic_policies: "US Domestic Policies"

 USA_dynamic_modifier_us_general_staff: "US General Staff"
 USA_dynamic_modifier_us_general_staff_desc: "Ever since the Cold War ended the American general staff apparatus has had to adapt to a more peace time oriented environment. As a result more and more red tape and cumbersome bureaucracy measures have begun to take over aspects of the procurement and R&D sectors. As a result and the continued peace a slow but growing problem of recruitment and logistical cohesion when conducting something as simple as maintaining barracks and other housing structures for the troops has begun to take hold.

So while the air force and army fight it over the budgeting amounts each fiscal period, many can't argue against the importance the US navy has in securing the current position the United States has in the globe."
 USA_dynamic_modifier_us_airforce: "United States Air Force"
 USA_dynamic_modifier_us_airforce_desc: "The US air force is the R&D special child. Being so advanced at points that R&D is now seen as more of a hobby at times rather than a true need for defence, regardless with most of the world still struggling against aircraft developed 40 nearly 50+ years ago it's no wonder that the US air force is one of the most feared entities out there.

 USA_american_tax_code: "American Tax Code"
 USA_american_tax_code_desc: "The tax code of the United States is one which is both hated and loathed by many. With the same energy in the same sentence, politicians have brought about and taken away change which has not only affected millions of Americans but also few Americans as well. The modern discontent with the Internal Revenue Service and the overall makeup of the tax code itself has been a very sensitive subject for the average American. But with the new Millennia comes new bills, and new bills mean new changes...the only hope is that those changes are good, rather than worse."

Traditionalist thinking where the news was supposed to be strictly non-politically oriented when addressing topics of the day, and then there were the activist camp. Modern thinking where the news through opinion pieces could be used to get the word out on issues that mattered, to spread awareness and so forth.

Statistics have shown a stark rise in children and women fatalities in relation to immigration as well as crimes related to human trafficking and other grossly illegal acts towards these refugees and migrants.

 USA_migrant_crisis_four: "A Growing Problem"
 USA_migrant_crisis_four_desc: "The Southern Border Problem is one which stretches back to in some cases 2013. Where a shocking rise in unattended minors were encountered at the border. Rising crime rates related to human trafficking and other severe crimes were also seen on the rise due to the slow out stretching of resources being allocated to handle both normal traffic flow as well as immigration patterns both legal and illegal. From 2021-2024 a series of economic, social and natural disasters would hit a handful of central American nations resulting in what some hyperbolize as a \"monsoon\" of immigrants. However to many the problem doesn't solely fall on just the immigration, but on a series of out dated as well as counter intuative economic and social policies which have grown to decay under the quagmire of federal politics and political theater. In the end of it all, a problem is only a problem if you choose not to solve it or if you decide to make it one in the first place. So in that case, where or what is the real problem then."

For America has never had an earnest immigration problem in the modern age as America does not have a domestically growing population. But, I hear you say, America's population grows year after year. Ah yes it does, but how many immigrants did the US see in that exact same time period, huh.

But while stability and order is kept in the nation there is the wonder if such illusions are cause of truth, or complicity and apathy for change.

He stated that the goal of the mission is to root out the Taliban and Al-Qaeda remnants from Afghan territory, and to restore peace and stability to the turbulent nation. This commitment to Afghanistan marks a major shift in American foreign policy, as now the United States will need to take a more active stance in the domestic affairs of other countries to ensure that the goals of its operations are being met. A large deployment to Afghanistan will also mean putting American troops at risk, which could seriously hurt the credibility of the American establishment greatly at the home-front.

 department_of_state.1.d: "The United States is calling on our government to move forward with a Green Energy agreement pushed by the previous Clinton administration. The agreement would call on us to abandon drilling operations in several oil fields in exchange for American-funded solar farms. The president of the United States, [USA.GetLeader], states that this move would be in our best interest, as it will 'reduce pollution greatly in major cities'. While some are skeptical on why the United States itself is no abandoning several mining operations within its own borders, this is an opportunity that would only come around once in a life time."

They are suggesting that we sign their agreement that'll require the disarmament of 8 military factories, and in exchange, the United States will construct 16 new civilian industries in order to replace them. Though the proposal appears quite enticing, there are worries that this is part of a greater American plan to slowly cripple Russia's military industries. With that in mind, we will gain more from actually agreeing to play along with their initiative because there is nothing that states that we cannot rebuild these industries."

Sudan has been bogged down in a state of civil war for decades now, with the nation growing more unstable every day.

 #Asteroid Mining Event Chain
 donald_trump.8.t: "Launching the Asteroid Mining Initiative"
 donald_trump.8.d: "Asteroid Mining has been a fantasy for many before us. Asteroids themselves carry much wanted platinum group metals, gold, silver, and iron group metals. It could become extremely lucrative for any spacefaring country. So today, the establishment of an Asteroid Mining Initiative, or AMI, will provide the first step towards mining asteroids. Using vast telescope arrays across the United States, we can look for suitable asteroids in nearby outer space, then pull it into orbit and mine it. Spotting a suitable asteroid will be difficult, as, relative to the distance they are at, they are quite small. Luckily, there's actually quite a few which pass by Earth every so often, so it wouldn't take long to get one to stay in Earth's orbit."
 donald_trump.8.o1: "Just need to wait for an asteroid..."

 donald_trump.9.t: "Asteroid Spotted"
 donald_trump.9.d: "Recently, our scientists at NASA spotted a suitable asteroid passing near Earth. This has been a relief for the AMI, as some doubted if we'd actually ever spot a suitable, economical asteroid at all. However, this asteroid is moving slowly enough, is large enough, and is rich enough to be moved into orbit and mined. The asteroid is, in-fact, larger than the state of New York. The next step is simply to move this asteroid into orbit around Earth, which has never been done before. In the meantime, NASA engineers, and even private enterprises like SpaceX, have invented mechanisms to mine the asteroid, so they will be ready by the time the asteroid gets into orbit."
 donald_trump.9.o1: "Let's get that baby into orbit"

 donald_trump.10.t: "Asteroid in Orbit"
 donald_trump.10.d: "With the asteroid in orbit, NASA and SpaceX are both sending missions to the orbiting asteroid. NASA is mainly concerned about collecting scientific data, while SpaceX is more concerned about mining the material. No doubt this is a noteworthy achievement, which gives us an edge in space. There is even talk about bringing in more asteroids, but many say that additional asteroids can come later, as this asteroid is very large and well suited for mining. Other countries are already looking at us with envy, and are considering their own asteroid mining programs. The costs are extremely high even to develop the technology to even get there, so there is little worry among SpaceX or NASA that competition will arive."
 donald_trump.10.o1: "Mining shall begin"

 donald_trump.11.t: "Profits from Mining Start Pouring in"
 donald_trump.11.d: "After establishing mining operations, SpaceX and NASA have both sent back their first shipments of space-material to labs and markets around the globe. The world has jealousy looked on us, and there have been open talks in their respective chambers of legislation about opening their own asteroid mining operations. While we soon may get competition, we can enjoy the monopoly for now."
 donald_trump.11.o1: "Huzzah!"

 donald_trump.12.t: "Profits from Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.12.d: "The latest shipments from our asteroid mining operations have come in, and have generated many revenues. These shipments include platinum, gold, and silver. Putting the revenues to good use would be wise."
 donald_trump.12.o1: "Excellent!"

 donald_trump.13.t: "Potential for Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.13.d: "Recently, Donald Trump has allowed NASA and SpaceX, a private space company, to bring a fairly large asteroid into orbit of Earth and mine it. Our advisors recommend we invest in this new space, as it could allow rare materials to be delivered straight to our country. Some, however, have cited the massive bill the United States had to pay to even start the operations, and oppose expanding into space. The return for this investment depends, but it may take 25 years to just break even. More substantial investment can bring this down, but we'll be far behind the United States for quite a while.\n\nWhat shall we do in regards to Asteroid Mining? Start a national program, or ignore it altogether?"
 donald_trump.13.o1: "Invest in Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.13.o2: "Too expensive and a waste of our time!"

 #Mission To Mars Event Chain

 #Some events are out of order for the event number, but in order for the chain both in the code and order it appears
 donald_trump.23.t: "Mission to Mars"
 donald_trump.23.d: "Mr. President, with funding secured, and plans complete, we can now prepare a group of men and women to withstand the immense pressure and loneliness in space in order to reach Mars.\n\nLuckily, NASA has already been preparing for such a trip for years, it's just not had the funding to launch a full program. The additional training of current astronauts and preparation of the rocket will start in earnest.\n\nThis process will take roughly a year for it to complete. In the mean time, scientists at NASA laboratories are preparing scientific equipment to be sent along with the astronauts to Mars to collect useful scientific data that one cannot achieve with a rover. Do keep in mind, SpaceX may attempt to get a man there first upon hearing the announcement."
 donald_trump.23.o1: "Preparations shall begin"

 donald_trump.24.t: "Space Race"
 donald_trump.24.d: "In a recent news release, SpaceX has decided to launch its own program to get to Mars in under a year. Now, if SpaceX gets there first, it will still be an achievement that you can use for additional investment into space, however, it will be... let's just say... not as politically convinient.\n\nThis new Space Race for Mars will require additional investment if we are wanting to secure victory first, however, some experts argue that Elon Musk's program lacks certain aspects required to go to Mars with a crewed mission there and back. We may just be able to get to Mars first without assigning additional funds to NASA.\n\nWhat is your directive, Mr. President?"
 donald_trump.24.o1: "Space Race it is!"
 donald_trump.24.o2: "Continue at the current pace"

 donald_trump.14.t: "Mission to Mars Ready"
 donald_trump.14.d: "NASA has just sent confirmation that the astronauts, equipment, and rocket are ready. There are six particular astronauts heading to Mars with a return journey. The astronauts heading to Mars are as follows: Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne. These astronauts have prepared over the past two years, and are the most fit astronauts for this mission. The rocket, NASA's recent Space Launch System, is ready to be launched. The capsule, the Orion Space Capsule, is also ready.\n\nFortunately, the next launch window is in 30 days."
 donald_trump.14.o1: "30 days until launch!"

 donald_trump.15.t: "On the Launch Pad"
 donald_trump.15.d: "[GetDateText]:\nOur six astronauts are ready. It will be a long difficult journey, but they are prepared for it. Paul seems especially excited about the prospect, while the rest of the crew is nervous, particularly Rodney, albeit willing.\n\nThe Astronauts are in the rocket, ready to blast off into Space. They gave their farewells to family and friends, for they will not see them in person for nearly two years. All are optimistic for a successful mission.\n\nThe countdown has begun, with the launch confirmed."
 donald_trump.15.o1: "3, 2, 1..."

 donald_trump.16.t: "Lift Off!"
 donald_trump.16.d: "Launch Control has certified liftoff, and the rocket and crew are heading to Mars! People's heads are towards the sky, as the rocket heading for orbit. Its crew are both ecstatic and relieved, as it's a perfect launch. Everything has worked so far, and there is much hope that it will continue to work for months to come.\n\nThe dream is near complete."
 donald_trump.16.o1: "An exciting day in history"

 donald_trump.17.t: "Disaster Strikes!"
 donald_trump.17.d: "The rocket has exploded!\n\nIt turns out that the essential final checks were inadequate to stop a catastrophe. It has been reported that all six crew members, Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne, have died in this calamity. The spectators on the ground are watching in disbelief as flames engulf the launch pad. It will much weaken the will for space in the coming future, and will be a stain on your presidency."
 donald_trump.17.o1: "A fatal accident"

 donald_trump.18.t: "Insanity in Space"
 donald_trump.18.d: "It turns out that prolonged periods in isolation with only five others to talk to are not suitable at all for the human psyche.\n\nDespite going through severe training before-hand, one astronaut, Michael, went mentally insane and attempted to manually control the craft to return to Earth as soon as possible. Anne, the only other person awake at the time, attempted to get in his way and halt him, however, she was unable to wrestle him away from the controls. While she was attempting to do this, Michael punched Anne in the jaw, knocking her unconcious.\n\nFortunately, the other crew members were wakened by the disorder, and immediately jumped to aid Anne. A quick struggle ensued where the control panel was slightly dented, however, everything remains operational and Michael is now in a makeshift prison with makeshift handcuffs. Additional good news, Anne was not permanently injured, and will be able to recover within a week on the vessel. Whether she has long term damage would have to be investigated by doctors at home.\n\nThe bad news is that the rocket is widely off-course. Additionally, a lot of fuel was burned in Michael's hasty attempt to return to Earth.\n\nThere are two options: Return to Earth with all the astronauts, arresting Michael for assualt and endangering five other lives, or send them on a one way trip to Mars. The five astronauts have expressed that they are willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of humanity.\n\nMr. President. What is your choice?"
 donald_trump.18.o1: "If the remaining astronauts are ready for it, then let them go"
 donald_trump.18.o2: "Let's get our men and women home, and arrest that son of a bitch"

 donald_trump.19.t: "Shamed Return"
 donald_trump.19.d: "Months ago, an altercation onboard the rocket to Mars forced the astronauts onboard to return to Earth to avoid a one-way trip. Anne has been sent to the hospital to investigate if she has injuries undiscovered by the crew, and Michael has been arrested and will likely be sent to a mental hospital. The other astronauts, other than Mary, have offered their services again to space, while Mary has decided to retire from her astronaut career early. They are all happy to be home alive.\n\nThis is likely the end to any government program to send humans to Mars for quite a long time to come."
 donald_trump.19.o1: "Unfortunate, but at least they're alive"

 donald_trump.20.t: "Sacrifice on Mars"
 donald_trump.20.d: "Weeks ago, an altercation onboard the rocket to Mars forced the astronauts to make the difficult decision to commit to a one-way trip to Mars. They have landed and have explored the Martian surface. They only have so long to live, so they intend to make the most of it. Significant research opportunities will result from this, however, it comes at a cost of human life. Stranded, and without a permanent source of food, the crew will starve and die on Mars, leaving their bodies on the surface until, hopefully, one day, a team comes to Mars to retrieve them and give a proper burial on Earth. Until then, they will lie there for eternity."
 donald_trump.20.o1: "Martyrs on Mars"

 donald_trump.21.t: "The Eagle has Landed"
 donald_trump.21.d1: "The landing on Mars is a success! The crew onboard is joyous, and the viewers at home on Earth are as excited as ever for space travel. They will stay here for a few days, taking scientific samples and experiments, before heading back to Earth. The excitement for space will ensure that future missions into space will be politically easy to do, and will enhance the popularity of your presidency. However, the United States is now, once again, pushing the boundaries of space."
 donald_trump.21.d2: "The NASA landing on Mars, the second successful landing to be had on Mars, is a success! The crew onboard is joyous, and the viewers at home on Earth, with this and the SpaceX landing, are as excited as ever for space travel. They will stay here for a few days, taking scientific samples and experiments, before heading back to Earth. The excitement for space will ensure that future missions into space will be politically easy to do, and will enhance the popularity of your presidency. However, the United States, both public and private, is now, once again, pushing the boundaries of space."
 donald_trump.21.o1: "Hip Hip Hurray for the USA!"
 donald_trump.21.o2: "Second isn't so bad"

 donald_trump.22.t: "Heroic Return"
 donald_trump.22.d1: "Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne have made it home safely on a trip which will make the history books as one of the most important space flights ever to have been achieved. They bring back countless rocks and priceless data that will be processed in laboratories all around the globe. Hopefully, this will pave the way for the future colonization of Mars."
 donald_trump.22.d2: "Despite being second, Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne have made it home safely on a round trip to Mars. They bring back countless rocks and priceless data that will be processed in laboratories all around the globe. Hopefully, this, along with the SpaceX landing, will pave the way for the future colonization of Mars."
 donald_trump.22.o1: "Our heroes are home"
 donald_trump.22.o2: "They're home"

 donald_trump.25.t: "SpaceX Reaches Mars"
 donald_trump.25.d1: "Despite our best efforts, SpaceX has managed to land on Mars first, beating us in the space race. They have landed their Starship on the Martian surface. This task for a private company was a huge undertaking, and we applaud them just for getting to Mars first, before NASA with it's huge financial advantage. We still celebrate this occasion, as it will bring many new discoveries to the sciences of space exploration and Mars."
 donald_trump.25.d2: "SpaceX is the second organization to land on Mars. They have landed their Starship on the Martian surface. This task for a private company was a huge undertaking, and we applaud them just for getting to Mars, just after NASA with it's huge financial advantage. We still celebrate this occasion, since it will hopefully lead to successes in the future for SpaceX and Elon Musk."
 donald_trump.25.d3: "SpaceX is the second organization to land on Mars, albeit will likely be the first to do a successful round trip. They have landed their Starship on the Martian surface, near the site where we landed our doomed mission, and are taking the bodies home, much to the relief of their families at home. This task for a private company was a huge undertaking, and we applaud them just for getting to Mars. We still celebrate this occasion, since it will hopefully lead to successes in the future for SpaceX and Elon Musk."
 donald_trump.25.o1: "Regardless of who does it first, it's still an amazing accomplishment"
 donald_trump.25.o2: "It's still an amazing accomplishment"

 #Lunar Outpost Event Chain

 donald_trump.26.t: "Outpost on the Moon"
 donald_trump.26.d: "Our scientists and engineers are ready to send astronauts and equipment to live semi-permanently on the Moon. A total sum of roughly 12 astronauts will be sent there, along with tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment, supplies, living spaces, and personal items. This outpost will need to be regularly moved as the Lunar day lasts 29 Earth days, which is far too long for batteries to keep stored power on the Moon.\n\nThe base itself will be on the poles, easily moveable, to get the maximum usage of our solar panels. Additionally, experiments will be carried out to determine long-term living conditions on the Moon. Extraction of lunar ice could not only lead to liquid water for plants and food for astronauts on the Moon, but also lead to separating it into oxygen and hydrogen, rocket fuel.\n\nThis may take months or years to get the research needed to do this. Within this time, however, using the funds for this project, we will build a depot orbiting the Moon to allow easier access to the Moon, and refueling to get to Earth.\n\nAll of this is achievable within the next decade. Now, however, is the time to launch."
 donald_trump.26.o1: "Launch!"

 donald_trump.27.t: "Moonbase Alpha"
 donald_trump.27.d: "Our scientists and engineers have officially landed on the Moon, and are currently in the process of setting up the Moon-base. Each section is divided into \"modules,\" not quite buildings on their own, but not together as one. There is a habitation module, for rest, food module, for growing food, lab module, which is the largest with most of the scientific equipment, a maintenance module, containing all the maintenance tools to repair things if they get broken, an amenities module, since these people are here for 6 months, and working all day everyday isn't good for the mind, and quite a few solar panels.\n\nFood deliveries will be common for these first months as it takes time to grow food. Water and oxygen will be obtained through the Lunar ice. Lastly, these scientists will stay until shortly after moving to the next location in roughly 6 months time when the solar panels become defunct due to the Lunar day and night where the outpost is located lasts 6 months.\n\nMoonbase Alpha is complete."
 donald_trump.27.o1: "Science!"

 donald_trump.28.t: "Colony Progresses"
 donald_trump.28.d: "Our scientific outpost on the Moon has had a major breakthrough. With expansion of their current solar panel network, and recent discoveries making separating water to make oxygen and hydrogen easier, they have been able to come up with enough oxygen and hydrogen to fully fuel the most recent supply rocket. This is such a necessary breakthrough which will allow the Moon itself, given enough time and investment, can become a hub for future space ventures into outer space.\n\nSpace itself is getting smaller."
 donald_trump.28.o1: "We're good at being pioneers"

 donald_trump.29.t: "Crisis on the Moon"
 donald_trump.29.d: "Drastic measures need to be taken place immediately. For reasons currently unknown, the habitation module has ruptured and \"exploded.\"\n\nAn hour ago, all 12 scientists were doing their duties when, all of a sudden, there was a massive rupture in the habitation module.\n\nSince waves don't travel in a vacuum, most didn't realize until they physically saw what had happened.\n\nThere is an emergency fund as part of the budget, so there is no need to allocate more funds to the project, and the scientists can always sleep in the other isolated modules; however, this has spooked many, stating that a few, many, or even all of our scientists could have died, and has also lowered the morale of the scientists since they could have died. Thus, attempting to continue the outpost on the Moon will be politically costly, and a rotation of scientists may need to happen now rather than later, due to the sapping of morale.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 donald_trump.29.o1: "Send emergency aid!"
 donald_trump.29.o2: "Abandon the project. It's not meant for us"

 donald_trump.30.t: "Colony Progresses Further"
 donald_trump.30.d: "Our Moon outpost has made another major breakthrough. They have managed to ship Hydrogen 3, a gas which seems perfect for fusion, to Earth, and scientists at home have figured out how to conduct fusion with it! Not only this, but the power generated from this fusion is near the amount used to do the reaction in the first place. This means that, with some improvements, this could result in successful fusion power! Not only does this allow immense benefits at home, along with knowledge we may be able to use in using other materials for fusion, we can use this on the Moon, allowing a permanent outpost rather than mobile outposts!\n\nAll of this is far ahead of schedule, which is a surpise, and many at NASA have been left unprepared to implement this into the current Moonbase. So, a new Moonbase is needed, in a much better spot for rapid expansion than the current location of Moonbase Alpha. It's time to start preparations on Moonbase Beta."
 donald_trump.30.o1: "Life continues on"

 donald_trump.31.t: "Another Crisis on the Moon"
 donald_trump.31.d: "More drastic measures need to be taken now. Two more modules have ruptured. This time, it's both the Food and Amenities modules.\n\nRoughly forty minutes ago, a scientist was about to enter the Food module when it suddenly exploded. The scientist is fine, and no-one but the plants were harmed. However, it was adjacent to the Amenities module, and it caused it to rupture and explode. Again, no-one was hurt.\n\nThis new occurance, however, has raised the hairs of many back home, questioning the saftey of the modules. After the previous explosion, NASA replaced the modules, ensuring that they wouldn't explode, but it seems like prolonged pressure can cause something to break much more easily than it would otherwise. NASA has already quickly responded, ordering new modules be made immediately, as well as a close inspection of all current modules (As you can't \"recall\" modules from the Moon as of this moment).\n\nWith mounting pressure at home to stop going forward with the project until all safety concerns are resolved, the continuation of the Moonbase program comes into question. In addition to the political pushback, the emergency fund has been cut in half, so NASA is requesting another $5 billion to sort out future concerns. It remains your choice to decide whether to continue."
 donald_trump.31.o1: "Send more emergency aid!"
 donald_trump.31.o2: "We can't continue doing things like this"

 donald_trump.32.t: "Moonbase Beta"
 donald_trump.32.d: "At this point, our scientists and engineers on the Moon need to move to another location on the poles. The costs for doing this are already established in the long-term budget, so we don't need to add any new funding to the project yet.\n\nWith this new moonbase, we will be able to use new discoveries we have uncovered to allow the base to be established permanently, unlike our previous moonbase.With the use of better rockets, better power generation, better ice extraction and separation, we can use this new base, at a site more suited for rapid expansion, to facilitate colonization efforts of the Moon. This is not the only good news, entreprenuers and corporations are flooding to NASA en-mass for requests to put their newly developed mining systems on the Moon. Even other space programs in other countries are now extremely interested in starting up scientific and mining outposts on the Moon, however, due to your dilligent efforts, we not only have a massive head start, but we are the only country actively attempting to colonize the Moon.\n\nThe future on our Moon is bright and American."
 donald_trump.32.o1: "Huzzah!"

 donald_trump.500.t: "Dealing with ISIS"
 donald_trump.500.d: "For years, ISIS has been a terrorist threat not seen ever in history. Their influence is all over the globe, and while their in Iraq and Syria shrinks, their strangleholds in other areas continues. A determined bombing campaign would put an end to the terrorist threat. It would certainly be costly; however, it would lead to the eventual demise of ISIS. Another approach is to simply continue operations normally, still pounding ISIS troops, but with far less costs than the former option. A last option is to fully withdraw from the campaign against ISIS as it has almost been won already. While this would strengthen ISIS, it would allow us to divert resources to other areas. Mr. President, what shall we do?"
 donald_trump.500.o1: "Withdraw from the region"

With ISIS a threat on our border, we may fully consider a subsidy to the United States of America for this action. Subsidizing this move will perhaps get us in a better standing with the United States, however, it will take money out of our own pockets."
 donald_trump.501.o1: "Subsidize American efforts"

 #News Events
 donald_trump_news.0.t: "US Suspends War Against ISIS"
 donald_trump_news.0.d: "In a surprising White House press release, the Trump Administration has announced the withdrawal of US forces from the fight against ISIS. Donald Trump tweeted upon the matter, calling ISIS a \"dead terrorist group\" and that \"US troops will focus on other things.\" Supporters call this move necessary to limit unnecessary expenditure, while the opposition state that this will only make the terrorism situation worse. Experts believe this will embolden ISIS into taking an offensive stance against her neighbors, as she gathers more fighters in Iraq and Sytria. The Administration has made no comment to this critique so far."

 donald_trump_news.1.t: "US Expands War Against ISIS"
 donald_trump_news.1.d: "Announcing in a tweet this morning, Donald Trump has stated that \"ISIS will face a war like never seen before.\" His tweets come after a short meeting with US Military staff, likely detailing the plans of the ISIS campaigns. In a press conference earlier today, WNN correspondant, Michael Miller, asked the President \"What are the current plans for American intervention against ISIS.\" Donald Trump replied to the statement by saying \"US bomber crews, of whom are very, very tough people, believe me. I mean, have you seen those people? They will fly over into Syria, and bomb the hell outta ISIS. Trust me, you will never have seen anything like it ever before.\" Experts warn this plan is expensive, but the President is adamant about his plans for ISIS. Additional details will be released soon about the matter."

 donald_trump_news.2.d: "Earlier today the President of the United States announced the Asteroid Mining Initiative. This organization \"will seek to find an asteroid, bring it into the orbit of Earth, mine it, and send its resources back to the USA.\" Many doubt if this could ever be profitable, as the immense costs will consume much of NASA's budget, however, the President has voiced his wishes for private space companies to do some of the work. One particular favorite, SpaceX, was pointed out directly in his speech on the AMI, stating \"Smart people, and boy, do we have some smart people, like my good friend at SpaceX, Elon Musk, will be able to send their space mining equipment to the asteroid, mine it, and sell it for profit. It will be a tremendous business, believe me.\" There are serious concerns for asteroid mining, however the Administration has been dismissive of those concerns, instead focusing on the rewards of the project. Whether this is successful or not will time will tell."

 donald_trump_news.3.d: "A large celebration was held in Florida today as shipments of platinum, gold, and silver reached the ground from space in a spectacular display. These materials of materials are not from any normal mine, but from asteroids.  A few months ago, NASA caught a large asteroid heading on a course which would place itself nearby earth. A relatively slow asteroid, it was pulled into an elliptical orbit with Earth. Mining operations started as soon as it was in orbit. This news has been a surpise to the world, as it has been done far faster than expected. Many countries are now seeking to start their own asteroid mining programs to counteract the American monopoly. The United States does claim the entire asteroid. However, this claim can only be sparsely enforced as the asteroid is so large. Asteroid mining will likely become a lucrative industry, with many successes and failures. Who will dominate the asteroid, nonetheless, remains a mystery."

Most that entertain these rumors have found nothing, however this does hark back to a very bizzare event that's still fresh in memory of someone who decided to create a economic machine in relation to betting against the market.

In a series of indepth investigations related to the crumbs of insider trading and the greater mortgage market has found a trail of rising unpayable mortgages and debts. These mortgages were being handed out to anyone who pretty much asked for them, not to mention all the fine print metrics we found like ballooning interest rates after a specific time frame or the actual size of the mortgages themselves in comparison to the holder's annual income. A comprehensive effort, albeit as quiet as possible effort to keep Wall Street from panicking is of the uptmost importance. A series of economic and political reforms will be put into effect to ensure that this sort of gross negligence is never allowed to grow into such proportions ever again."

 USA_unrest_event.1.d: "Recent weeks have seen a steady increase to what is known as the Libertarian party. Most see them as a crackpot overtly capitalist party, but with the rising rallies and registration numbers some fear that they may make a potential comback if left alone. With the media's help we could do something to quash their momentum, or we could just leave them alone as their bound to be snuffed out again."

Unfortunately it does not look like the case, recently an increase in Socialist oriented groups have been organizing protest and movements against our nation's ethos. These rabblerousers are causing a stir and in all honesty they are nothing more than just a pest of a bygone era.

However, there are some who worry that they may be taking things a step too far. Elements of the Constitutional Party and backdoor dealings with supposed plutocratic insiders have caused unease in the public.

So far there seems to be three main factions developing. The Liberty Guardsmen, which is an old guard like faction looking to keep the party status quo. The Free Business Association, which looks to further the economic deregulations. Finally there is the STEM Committee, a faction of engineers, chemist and general technical specialist who look to further the forms of liberty through science and rationalism. Many are unsure who may win, but whoever does will hopefully be able to keep the continued stability enjoyed currently."

 ##Military Junta Events
 USA_reformed_republic.100.t: "Military Sees Growth"
 USA_reformed_republic.100.d: "In the past couple of weeks military leaders have been in a state of joy. The reason, a steady rise in militarism in the population as civilian groups call for expansions and more additions to JROTC programs in school. Local so called community militia units have also begun to spring up and re-enactment events have seen a steady rise in popularity. While many believe this to be a good thing for the NFP, some of the hardliners are cautious due to the supposed balance the coalition was to have."
 USA_reformed_republic.100.o1: "Why Ruin A Good Thing?"
 USA_reformed_republic.101.t: "Party Base Shifts"
 USA_reformed_republic.101.d: "Rising concerns by hardliners within the NFP have started voicing the fact that a notable shift in the party base has begun. The military has seen rising volunteer numbers as well as national and state guard units have seen more towards raising the praises of the Pentagon elite then they have of the national leaders. Most of the voting base however has been seen as dismissing these concerns as in the words of one member quote, We all want a strong military and so who cares, end quote. Nevertheless the hardliners have become nervous over the shifting tides of the party."

 ##American Fascist Events
 USA_reformed_republic.200.t: "Public Naturalism Grows"
 USA_reformed_republic.200.d: "Fascist as well as their hardliner friends in the ANP and KKK have been in a state of glee as recent national trends show a growing demand of the US becoming more in line with its naturalistic history. A rise in attacks against ethnic minorities and essentially anyone who does not fit the supposed \"American\" identity. This essentially boils down to a Western European identity as the olive skinned peoples of the Southwestern parts of Europe were seen as products of their times. Many in the military are indifferent but a lot of moderates within the NFP are seeing concerns of a potential party shift as public trends seem to begin favoring one of the major factional groups within the NFP."

 USA_reformed_republic.201.t: "Moderates Seek Asylum"
 USA_reformed_republic.201.d: "National news breaks as cowardly fence sitters and seditionist flee the nation. The new party head of the NFP has seen fit to declare that quote, \"The enemies of the state as well as their feeble ideals flee our great nation. Today marks a real turning point in America's history as we the people now have the true rule.\" The speech went on for roughly a total of three hours as radios and television stations alike were lit up broadcasting this speech to all who would watch or listen. Global leaders are wary of the new American government and talks have already begun of what America's status should be with it no longer being the beacon of Democracy."

 USA_reformed_republic.300.t: "Modern Monarchism?"
 USA_reformed_republic.300.d: "Monarchism, a term used to describe the old era of nearly a century ago. Yet through apparently strength of will a new movement has lead the forefront of the NFP. The \"Modern Monarchist Movement\", is a faction that wishes to breath a modern light onto an old ideal. Through countless of rallies, speeches, informational pamphlets and so on the MMM have made clear that the modern system will not change, but rather be cosmetically altered. Many are skeptical of this new group but with the slogan, \"Every Man A King, Every Woman A Queen\", some do like the idea of making that little childhood fantasyy into a modern reality."
 USA_reformed_republic.300.o1: "What Fantasy Show Will This Be?"
 USA_reformed_republic.301.t: "Fantasy, More Like Reality"
 USA_reformed_republic.301.d: "In a shocking turn of events the MMM has secured majority power within the NFP, with radicals in the naturalist camp leaving the party and finding isolation in the wilds and forests of the expanse of continental America. The military is easier to convince due to the historic implications that monarchies have always prided their military. As for the fence sitters, well they're still sitting, enjoying the peace and understanding that things are not getting worse so its only up from here. The MMM has begun making swift moves to inform the public as well as the greater world to ensure a peaceful rise and understanding of what many fear is the fall of the American Eagle."

 ##Commissariat Coup Events

 USA_reformed_republic.400.d: "The Commissariat Corps is the military political wing of the Red Army. This group has seen more volunteers and interest in understanding the way to properly militarize the nation in line with the Socialist principles which will free our nation from the old order. Recently though the national committee has had some concerns over the growing ranks and popularity of the Commissariat Corps, though CC leadership assures the committee that there are know plans to do anything drastic. This has not stopped rumors from spreading in the lower ranks of the Corps."
 USA_reformed_republic.400.o1: "Surely You Jest, Right?"
 USA_reformed_republic.401.t: "The Red Junta?"
 USA_reformed_republic.401.d: "In a shocking twist which looks like weeks of pre-meditated planning, a cabal of young officers in the Commissariat Corps have initiated a coup and established what they call the \"Red Junta\". This Socialist Military Junta seems to want to take the idea of national pride in service to the country and combine it with the ideas of Socialist economics. Given how both ideals can be used in an egalitarian and or unitarian sense many are surprisingly taken with the idea. But for now moderates and global spectators look on wondering what will this new faction will do."

 ## American Trotskyist Events
 USA_reformed_republic.500.t: "The Socialist Workers Party"
 USA_reformed_republic.500.d: "In recent weeks the rise of the SWP has seen some heads turn in both intruige and disgust. Most see the pro-trotskyist party as a stain on real socialist principles, while others see them as mear idealist who want nothing but power. Nevertheless some concern has arose as more people seem to be joining the ranks of the SWP and it is threatening to tip the balances of power within the coalition. Party leadership is looking to cull any excesses to the SWP's influences but many are unsure if it will help."
 USA_reformed_republic.500.o1: "The Global Revolution...Suffering More Like It."
 USA_reformed_republic.501.t: "Ruthless Coup!"
 USA_reformed_republic.501.d: "In a shocking turn of events, organizers from the SWP have seized power and slaughtered key coalition leaders. The SWP leadership has proclaimed quote, \"We the members of the Socialist Workers Party have done the nation a favor. For it is time that we stop playing games and understand the true goals and ideals that Socialism and Socialist want. Unity, not compromise is the future and we will ensure that future is a reality. For The Socialist Dream!!!\". Many have begun to flee the nation and some nations around the world are already looking to impose sanction on the United States of America and wonder what the future truly entails. For now many are worried and buying time to defend from potential incursions."
 USA_reformed_republic.501.o1: "Dear God, What Have We Done."

 ## American Anarchist Society Events
 USA_reformed_republic.600.t: "The American Anarchist Society"
 USA_reformed_republic.600.d: "The AAS or American Anarchist Society is a fringe and clearly out of date political entity. Supposedly under the assumption that Anarchism can suvive in such a civilized world, they tout their pamphlets and make speeches about the collective good and goals of the society. Well despite a slight trend in their membership and positions in the coalition, many discount them no more better than the quirks of the fringe."
 USA_reformed_republic.600.o1: "*scoffs* What Are We Apes?"
 USA_reformed_republic.601.t: "The Impossible Clearly Was Possible"
 USA_reformed_republic.601.d: "In a confusing and outlandish series of events, somehow the AAS has secured a majority within the coalition. Many onlookers both domestically and internationally stare in a mix of disbelief and confusion as the epitome of Oxymoronic actions have culminated in what is being proclaimed as the quote, \"First Elected Anarchist Government\". Nevertheless things appear to be moving on as normal but many still stare in an almost catatonic state at what is there to actually do now. But only time will tell if this is a ruse or something to be excited or dishearted by, only time can truly tell at this point."

Several deaths which have transpire are being blamed on the protests due to the delays which emergency services have suffered. Some governors and even members of congress are drawing up plans to deal with the problem.

More now even locally are wanting the president to intervene to restore order as local officials appear to not be convicted enough to make decisive actions. Though it looks like there maybe a break in the intensity, it could backfire as public trust has already sunken to a new low.

 #Mini Crisis Event Chain 2
 USA_crisis_event.4.t: "Congress Does It Again"
 USA_crisis_event.4.d: "Shocking news has come out of congress that the fiscal appropriations bill has not been resolved and is being deadlocked by members tacking on addendums and additives to the overall legislation. We've had these scares before, let alone the last real government shutdown was back in 95, so there shouldn't be to much to worry about."

Many are beginning to fear the economic ramifications as federal programs have essentially grown into a redundant state. Wall Street has seen a slow drop in the DOW and S&P 500 respectively as even the supposed lobbyist are gobsmacked at these recent turn of events.

Congress has finally found a way to pass the legally required appropriations bill to continue normal government functions. Whether for better or worse it does look like things are back to a somewhat level state. For now the quote, Eternal Shutdown, has come to an end, lets just hope we don't repeat this...please."

As such I made a semi-serious prediction stating that quote. \"If we continue the self destructive trend of fighting over everything that feels like we should fight over, rather than what we should actually talk about. Then I genuinely fear that in the next 50 years we may not see a \"United\" States.\" Since barely anyone ever played so far, the 2067 option was originally added as an easter egg teaser, but now as the general player base is getting closer to the game year it needs to be an option now.

 USA_collapse_event.1.o1: "Can We Fix This?!?"
 USA_collapse_event.2.t: "Congress Proposes Deal"
 USA_collapse_event.2.d: "The scramble for a fair deal to avoid the strike has come with a heavy heart. Strikers and the Class 1's which are being affected are at a stand still. A major problem being argued constantly is the points system used to regulate how employees take days off whether sick or not. This gross umbrella-ing of how to keep employees at work and efficient in their jobs has resulted in a strong animosity. This tension has now come to head and congress has hit a road block with the reality of the situation becoming a growing fear for DC as a whole."

 USA_collapse_event.3.t: "The Negotiations Fall Through"
 USA_collapse_event.3.d: "Negotiations have exploded in on themselves as panic on Wall Street has seen a recession like fall in the stock market. The impact of the strikes has seen several governors declare a state of emergency to try and quell ever rising public disorder.

 USA_collapse_event.4.d: "Federal intervention initially saw good results as certain areas did see a sort of calm. However in harder hit areas opportunists have taken this same government intervention and stirred the pot too much. Civilian casualties have begun to be reported and droves of refugees have begun to leave the nation. Rumors along with the media's ever so hyperbolic mantra has only made the issue worse with ever growing amounts of reports of mass rioting and looting consuming the entire nation. This snowballing trend has resulted in ever growing amount of property damage and destruction of infrastructure as a whole. National Guard units have begun mobilizing and DoD command is scrambling plans to try and taper down the situation."

However loyalist military personnel have taken up defensive posturing in what is now being called the Federalist states.

As this \"debate\" rages on a lot more people who are not really active in terms of the news cycle realize the growing issue our federal government has become. With some saying its purely D.C.'s fault for this issue, while others say its the fault of older generations for not thinking ahead. Younger generations are starting to slowly become more politically active as the American Dream begins to turn into the American Make Believe, with many siting inconsistent and outright decaying reforms and regulations which have left younger generations in the dust in terms of economic mobility and opportunity.

On one hand you have Hillary Clinton, a veteran politician with a wealth of experience at the federal level as well as foreign policy. A strong and committed Democrat. To her left is Senator Bernie Sanders another veteran politician that is very charismatic despite his age, Senator Sanders has been a very strong leader for the Progressive movement in America, despite what opposition leaders may have you believe he is a \"Socialist\", the reality is, he's more of a mix of center-left and the standard Demsoc you might find in Europe, at least when looking through the perspective of American social and econmic policies that is. Finally to the right hand side of both we have Donald Trump, businessman, novice and changing political interest as Trump has been a registered Democrat, Republican and even at one point joined Ross Perot's Reform Party back during his election bid for president. Trump is seen as a half breed between Evangelical and center-right, with inconsistent policy positions throughout the right spectrum as well as a supposed \"pro-America\" policy in relation to taxes and business incentivizing. In the end this cross roads will determine if and when America could see a major shift. For now lets just see who wins."

The administration has stated that this ruling does a strong blow to false asylum seekers which are inhibiting real asylum seekers from getting the care and attention they need.

Currently as of January 22nd Texas National Guard units and federal BP agents are at a stand off, with a continued tit for tat over the setting up and destroying of razer wire similar to what you would see on a military outpost defensive fence line.

 USA_crisis_event.1107.d: "Back in January Texas forces had a stand off with federal forces at Eagle Pass at a place called Shelby Park. Federal forces withdrew and continued the tit for tat tactics related to the more aggressive defensive \"fortifications\" they were putting along the border. However a statement has come out directly from the federal government which had detailed that Texas forces should stand down and let the federal government do its contitutional and legal job of maintaining the national border in the south along its Mexican neighbor. This statement was left unanswered and things had seemed to quiet down, however ealier today an official statement was released by the governor of Texas stating that quote, \"The federal government has failed in its constitutional and legal duties to protect and maintain the security of the national border. As such I and as well as all of Texas and her local law and military forces will do whatever is needed to at the very least protect our own borders.\" Several states have already sent aid and manpower to the state of Texas in the force of volunteer law enforcement personnel and national guard soldiers with estimates of up to 500 national guard soldiers being sent by several other states who supported the actions of Texas in the on going crisis. This more or less hostile approach has many worried that America is on the brink of a constitutional crisis as both sides begin to take shape over whether or not Texas or the federal government is truly at fault."

Many fear that Texas is on the cusp of doing something drastic and the federal government is looking to find ways to handle the situation without overt aggression. As one insider source states, \"People know Texas is technically in the wrong, but we've reach the national level of involvement and in general no one has been happy with the federal government on either side. So we need to do whatever possible to ensure that we can openly and quickly prove we are not the bad guys by how we treat the situation.\" Many hardliners see this as spineless, however moderates and even some opposition viewers have stated their open support and surprise at the handling of the federal government."

However it was during the start of July's emergency session which resulted in a shock to the nation. As it was reported no representatives both House and Senate had showed up from the state of Texas. Soon news reporters were swarming the Texas governors office about the situation in which he held a press conference over the situation. At the press conference all absent members had shown up and pledged their protest in union with one another of the federal government's over stepping boundaries and pure negligence. For not just Texas but to the border states and some may even say the general states of this very union we call ourselves. Soon after the declaration of protest the governor ended the press conference to a flurry of pleas and questions from the crowd of new reporters as now the protest and Texas's now open defiance against the federal government was broadcast to the nation. A response from the federal administration stated that quote, \"This is an outright challenge to the authority and duties of the federal government. More so it is a challenge to the union for which we have had since 1865 when we solidified and reintegrated the confederate states back into the union and came to the unified understanding of the meaning and principles of our very existence as a nation.\" Though many were inspired by these words, some were worried it may only cause other states to side with Texas if they felt disconnected or left behind by the federal government.

Fears have struck a fever pitch as never before has a hard border been established within the United States before, even with the Civil War open rebellion was first followed by the \"established border of the south\". It is with this notion that the federal government has issued an ultimatum to the state of Texas and its government. It reads, \"Cease all establishment of a hard border within these United States or the state of Texas will be declared in open rebellion and placed under marshal law until the rebellion is under control.\" This declaration comes at a horrible time as its only been a year into the new presidency as well as things are nearing the holidays. Many are afraid of a war in their own backyard as rumors are abound of state governments weighing their options and wondering just what will the federal government do to the citizens of Texas and technically their own citizens by proxy.

However the most concerning thing is they might not be the only ones. Rumors and fears are rampant of more potentially leaving the union as well as desertions and mutinies within the army as many genuinely don't want to turn their guns on fellow Americans despite if they agree with them or not. This ungodly moralism has lead to a slight fit of lock up in military cohesion and actions as orders are getting lost and troops are not always cooperating with officers.

 USA_crisis_event.1117.t: "No More Friends"
 USA_crisis_event.1117.d: "Looks like yet a domino falls for the supposed union. The heavily \"pro-federal\" states of the New England region have decided to peace out and form a regional government. In a statement made to national press, quote, \"In the beginning we saw the Texan and Southern rebellions as simple minded slaughter against America. However with the declared neutrality of the Lakota territories and the states around them being met with immediate hostility from the federal government. We have now seen the true colors of the Washington governmental body for what it really is, a power hungry and desperate defense against its status quo. We have therefore put it upon ourselves to declare similar neutrality from the on going conflict and expect to be declared on within hours or days of this declaration. God help us all.\" Things have certainly taken a free fall from here."

 USA_crisis_event.1119.t: "Puerto Who?"
 USA_crisis_event.1119.d: "In all the confusion and chaos it looks like Puerto Rico has left and declared independence. They were a territory and so there is no real justification to rampantly go back after them. Plus when you think about it they do cost us on average more cause you can only do so much on an island compared to the mainland."

 USA_crisis_event.1120.o1: "God Save Texas"
 USA_crisis_event.1121.t: "Rally Behind The Flag"
 USA_crisis_event.1121.d: "With the recent independence a call to arms has been declared as well as the mobilization of the national guard and state guards of the respective Southern states. We will do our best to stand firm against federal tyranny and stand by the principled Texans."
 USA_crisis_event.1121.o1: "God Save The South!"
 USA_crisis_event.1122.t: "They've Come To Kill Us"
 USA_crisis_event.1122.d: "Despite our clear intention of anti-conflict the federal government prizes their arms over their citizens. We may not last long but with whatever national guard we do have we can arm them andf send them to the mountains. We need to do whatever to send a message, a message of the failed federal entity over the principles of the old union."

 ##### Flashpoint Event Status Quo
 USA_crisis_event.1207.t: "The Courts Take Over"
 USA_crisis_event.1207.d: "In the aftermath of the Eagle Pass stand off, a steady back and forth through the legal system, department of homeland security as well as different levels of the courts began to toss around and attempt to solve the more or less on going stand off between Texas and federal forces. For the most part little has changed and the continued tit for tat over Texas's Operation Lone Star continues. As Texas forces continue to put down wire and \"fortification\" federal BP agents continue to work to take down said instruments of obstruction. Over all the situation seems to most be at a stand still but continued legal preceedings are still on going. Many hope that as time goes on and elections on the horizon that this change of leaderships will allow for a peaceful end to the current, \"meh\", state of affairs."

 ##### Flashpoint Event Reformed Republic
 USA_crisis_event.1307.t: "Public Outcry Against All"
 USA_crisis_event.1307.d: "Following the tense standoff at Eagle Pass organized protests of independents and other political party advocacy groups have been protesting both the Texas and federal governments and forces into taking up a meeting to properly resolve the issues at hand. These coordinated protests have been targeting government officials and military/law enforcement agents on both sides that decided to go near the border as well as in or out of their installations. As such rumors have it that either side have decided to look into actually conducting talks and opening a real dialogue over the situation which affects the southern border states."
 USA_crisis_event.1307.o1: "Holy Crap They Can Act Like Adults"
 USA_crisis_event.1308.t: "Lexington Convention"
 USA_crisis_event.1308.d: "Representatives of both the southern border state governments lead by Texas and representatives of the federal administration have met up in Lexington, Kentucky to discuss and genuinely approach the supposed border problem. The meeting itself started off a little heated as some border representatives were just tired of the political pressure caused by the overt increase in traffic flow around their states as there is no increase in resources to account and tend to such increases. However neutral controlling parties tempered these outbursts before they could escalate. After a generally lengthy debate and back and forth a general aggreement was reached. Budgetary increases to improve processing facilities, recruit more personnel and set a plan for a genuine border line to help monitor and look out for migrants looking to enter the US regardless of legal or illegal intent to limit excesses in oversight will be implemented as soon as possible. Consequently plans will be drafted by the USBP agency and congress with local state governments to create new border crossing facilities to allow for better disemmination of traffic to and from the US and Mexico as well as better spread out immigration processing as well. Many see this as a win for the nation as a whole as political and independent activists were able to create enough pressure against not only state but federal officials to cause genuine change related to a political manner. In the following days more and more organized political movements would cause pressures for political and ecdonomic reforms which have many more debating on the validity of the current two party system."

# DRAFT FOR EXPANDED WAR ON TERROR

# - - - - AFGHANISTAN - - - -

# - The Taliban insurgency system would revolve around Taliban forces retreating to rural parts of Afghanistan
# - Key figures will need to eliminated via raids
# - Raids can be done by the U.S., or any OEF coalition member
# - These figures will be found in the rural areas of Afghanistan, and Pakistan
# - You need to negotiate with Pakistan first, otherwise you risk them backing a Taliban offensive
# - The Afghan Army will have to take out Taliban holdings through border wars, the U.S. can only help via equipment, training, and raids
# - Whatever territory the Taliban holds by the time the U.S. withdraws will be the territory the Taliban gains once the U.S. withdraws. Once the U.S. withdraws, a conventional HOI war will initiate between Afghanistan and the Taliban
# - The poorer Afghanistan is, the stronger the Taliban becomes as a result of radicalization. This needs to be resolved via investments into Afghanistan

# - - - - IRAQ - - - -

# - GUI will be constructed based off of real life U.S. Army playing cards with key targets
# - Targets will need to be found via La Resistance upgrades and intel on Iraq *Influence if no DLC
# - Raids are 1 time attempt. If they fail, then the target will escape and work with the resistance
# - Each time a target is taken out, an 'X' will be placed over their card
# - If the target escapes, the card will be flipped over
# - The longer you take to eliminate all targets, the more radicalized the resistance movement will become. Essentially a shift from a Nationalist Ba'athist resurgence movement to a radicalized Islamist one
# - While targets are on the loose, terror attacks could take place that hurt the U.S. *Will be done through in game events
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
