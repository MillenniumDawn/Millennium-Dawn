  CHI_Chairman_Jiang_Reign_desc:0 "The successor of the illustrious Deng Xiaoping to the Presidency of China, Jiang Zemin, was a man committed to free-market reforms as well as the political supremacy of the CCP. In the years leading up to the turn of the millennium, Jiang kicked off his term with a number of different policies including a series of privatizations."
  CHI_End_PLA_Business_Ventures:0 "End PLA Business Ventures"
  CHI_End_PLA_Business_Ventures_desc:0 "In order to make up for defence budget cuts under Deng Xiaoping, the country’s military, the PLA, started acquiring business ventures in the 1970s. However the government has recently started to become concerned by this phenomenon due to increasing corruption in the PLA as well as the threat posed by allowing the military to gain control over a significant portion of the country’s economy. A new directive to remove the PLA from most sectors of the economy is therefore necessary, but in order to placate the military we must implement this alongside an increase in the military budget."
  CHI_Future_of_the_CPC:0 "The Future of the CPC"
  CHI_Future_of_the_CPC_desc:0 "As much as the Communist Party of China likes to present itself as a strong, united entity, it is not immune to fissures along factional lines. We must choose which, if any faction we desire to favour."
  CHI_Three_Represents_Thought:0 "Three Represents Thought"
  CHI_Three_Represents_Thought_desc:0 "The “Three Represents” is a theory of what the Communist Party represents as put forward by Jiang Zemin. The theory states that the Communist Party must be representative of advanced social productive forces, advanced culture, and the interests of the majority."
  CHI_Youth_League_Dominance:0 "Communist Youth League Dominance"
  CHI_Youth_League_Dominance_desc:0 "The Chinese Communist Youth League is an influential organization that has groomed a large number of Communist Party officials, including vice-president Hu Jintao. The alumni of the organization tend to be slightly more politically liberal than other party officials, and tend to identify themselves more with the rural lower classes, striving for socioeconomic equality wherever possible. However, they are by no means pro-democracy and are willing to use force to put down insurrection if necessary."
  CHI_Preserve_CPC_Unity:0 "Preserve CPC Unity"
  CHI_Preserve_CPC_Unity_desc:0 "China cannot prosper if either the Communist Youth League or the Shanghai clique wield too much unchallenged influence. We must strive to keep both factions in check."
  CHI_Shanghai_Clique_Dominance:0 "Shanghai Clique Dominance"
  CHI_Shanghai_Clique_Dominance_desc:0 "The Shanghai Clique is a political faction centred around Jiang Zemin, a grouping made up predominantly of pro-business politicians, princelings, and individuals hailing from China’s more wealthy, urban areas. This faction is keen to implement free-market reforms and rapid economic development as quickly as possible."
  CHI_End_Class_Warfare:0 "End Class Warfare"
  CHI_End_Class_Warfare_desc:0 "As a result of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents Thought”, the foundations of Chinese political thought have been substantially, if subtly amended. While Mao’s underlying ideology relied on class warfare in favour of the rural peasants against the urban bourgeoisie, Jiang’s more pro-business orientation has led him to favour an end to this aspect of Chinese governance in favour of an inclusion and acceptance of the Chinese business and entrepreneurial class."
  CHI_Hu_Jintao_Agenda:0 "Hu Jintao's Agenda"
  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Agenda:0 "Zeng Qinghong's Agenda"
  CHI_Peaceful_Rise:0 "China's Peaceful Rise"
  CHI_Peaceful_Rise_desc:0 "The perception of China as a threat to international peace and security is not uncommon in the US and amongst our neighbours. To counter this, we should adopt the official policy of “China’s peaceful rise” or, to put it in an even less threatening way, “China’s peaceful development”. This will assure our Western and regional partners that we do not seek conflict."
  CHI_Scientific_Outlook_on_Development:0 "Scientific Outlook on Development"
  CHI_Scientific_Outlook_on_Development_desc:0 "In many ways a backlash by Hu Jintao against the growth-centric focus of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, the “Scientific Outlook on Development” is the theoretical underpinning of Hu’s government, one that focuses on sustainable growth that minimizes environmental pollution and socioeconomic inequality."
  CHI_Harmonious_Society:0 "Harmonious Society"
  CHI_Harmonious_Society_desc:0 "As part of Hu Jintao’s scientific outlook on development, the Chinese government is under a new directive to establish a “harmonious society” in which social injustice is not left unchecked in the wake of unhindered economic growth."
  CHI_Green_GDP:0 "Green GDP"
  CHI_Green_GDP_desc:0 "A key tenet of the scientific outlook on development is sustainability. As such, we should encourage provincial officials to measure economic growth with a new yardstick, Green GDP. If this policy becomes widespread, this could reduce the level of environmental degradation that is brought about by our rapid economic development."
  CHI_Set_up_Confucius_Institutes:0 "Set up Confucius Institutes"
  CHI_Set_up_Confucius_Institutes_desc:0 "In order to project Chinese soft power abroad, we can establish Confucius Institutes around the world to teach Chinese culture and the Chinese language."
  CHI_Global_Chinese_Culture:0 "Global Chinese Culture"
  CHI_Global_Chinese_Culture_desc:0 " As a further continuation of our policy of conducting diplomacy through soft power, we should make use of our unique culture and history to increase our global influence."
  CHI_Develop_Chinese_Cinema:0 "Develop Chinese Cinema"
  CHI_Develop_Chinese_Cinema_desc:0 " America has Hollywood, India has Bollywood. Even Nigeria has Nollywood. The Chinese film industry has historically had little success beyond China’s borders, failing even to achieve substantial popularity within China itself. Investing in the Chinese film industry can help further our cultural diplomacy by giving a much needed boost to our soft power."
  CHI_8_Honours_8_Shames:0 "8 Honours and 8 Shames"

  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Agenda:0 "Zeng Qinghong's Agenda"
  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Agenda_desc:0 "The strengthening of the Shanghai Clique has paved the way for Jiang Zemin’s so-called “hatchet man” to assume leadership of the Communist Party and the nation. Zeng will have to overcome his limited popularity in the party relative to figures like Hu Jintao and Wen Jiaobao to push his reformist agenda."
  CHI_Affirm_Ties_to_the_Military:0 "Affirm Ties to the Military"
  CHI_Affirm_Ties_to_the_Military_desc:0 "In order to make changes to the composition of the Communist Party, Zeng Qinghong must make use of his connections to powerful military generals. These ties must be strengthened before any inevitably unpopular reformist agenda is pursued."
  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Thought:0 "Zeng Qinghong Thought"
  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Thought_desc:0 "Building upon Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, Zeng has formulated a new ideological underpinning for the CPC, one that stresses the duty of the party to represent the majority of Chinese people. Zeng Qinghong thought calls for a more accountable and transparent party that can be perceived as more representative and legitimate by the Chinese people. Key to this theory is the idea of the “gaze of the people” and how party officials can only maximize the interests of the country when working under this gaze."
  CHI_Intra_Party_Democracy:0 "Intra-Party Democracy"
  CHI_Intra_Party_Democracy_desc:0 "One of Zeng Qinghong’s key ideas is that of intra-party democracy, in which elections are used to select local-level party secretaries. Now that he has come to power, this idea can be expanded to encompass a range of new reforms to increase transparency and accountability within the communist party."
  CHI_Increase_Local_Autonomy:0 "Increase Local Autonomy"
  CHI_Increase_Local_Autonomy_desc:0 "Part of Zeng Qinghong’s transparency initiative is the construction of a more federal system, one in which officials can be more accountable and feel more connected to the provinces in which they operate."
  CHI_Public_Examinations:0 "Public Examinations"
  CHI_Public_Examinations_desc:0 "In order to fill the Communist Party apparatus with the most competent officials possible, Zeng has ordered that all lower-level posts should be filled through rigorous public examinations rather than by appointment. This policy will require a more substantial party bureaucracy."
