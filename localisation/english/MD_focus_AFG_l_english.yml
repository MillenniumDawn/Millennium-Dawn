 #History
 AFG_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Since the communists took power in 1978, Afghanistan has been in a state of civil war and external intervention and invasion. the withdrawal of the Soviet Union in 1989 and the fall of the communist regime in 1992 did not bring peace, but rather the conflict of interests between the mujahideen factions led to continued fighting between the factions until 1996 when the Pakistani-backed Taliban took advantage of the civil war between the major factions to seize Kabul and large parts of Afghanistan. Although the warring factions were still in conflict, the Taliban's goal was to eliminate all the factions, forcing the formerly warring factions to form a northern alliance against the Taliban under the mediation of General Massoud. A large number of civilians were harmed by war crimes in the endless war. What does the future hold for this war-torn country?"
 AFG_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "With the help of the coalition forces, the Northern Alliance successfully toppled the Taliban regime. Instead of being annihilated, the Taliban have fragmented and started waging an insurgency in various parts of Afghanistan, posing a significant threat to coalition and government forces. While some actions of coalition forces is one of the reasons for the Taliban's growth, the inefficiency and corruption of the government and Afghanistan's unique pre-modern tribal culture are the main reasons why the Taliban are difficult to annihilate, not to mention the fact that Taliban militants can hide and regroup in parts of Pakistan and go back to fight in Afghanistan. Will the government forces end the Taliban insurgency? Or there will be a peace deal to convince the Taliban to peacefully lay down their arms and join the government?"

#Leader Description:
 GULBUDDIN_HEKMATYAR_DESC: "Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is an Afghan politician and former mujahideen leader. He is the founder and leader of the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin political party, so called after Mohammad Yunus Khalis split from Hezb-e Islami in 1979 to found Hezb-i Islami Khalis. He has twice served as Prime Minister during the 1990s. Hekmatyar joined the Muslim Youth organization as a student in the early 1970s, where he was known for his Islamic radicalism rejected by much of the organization.\n\nHe spent time in Pakistan before returning to Afghanistan when the Soviet–Afghan War began in 1979, at which time the CIA began funding his rapidly growing Hezb-e Islami organization through the Pakistani intelligence service, ISI, one of the largest of the Afghan mujahideen. He received more CIA funding than any other mujahideen leader during the Soviet-Afghan War.\n\nFollowing the ouster of Soviet-backed Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah in 1992, Hekmatyar declined to form part of the new government and, with other warlords, engaged in the Afghan civil war, leading to the death of around 50,000 civilians in Kabul alone. Hekmatyar was accused of bearing the most responsibility for the rocket attacks on the city. In the meantime, as part of the peace and power-sharing efforts led by Ahmad Shah Massoud, Hekmatyar became Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1993 to 1994 and again briefly from 1996 to 1997."
 MOHAMMED_ZAHIR_SHAH_DESC: "Serving for 40 years, Zahir was the longest-serving ruler of Afghanistan since the foundation of the Durrani Empire in the 18th century. He expanded Afghanistan's diplomatic relations with many countries, including with both sides of the Cold War. In the 1950s, Zahir Shah began modernizing the country, culminating in the creation of a new constitution and a constitutional monarchy system. Demonstrating nonpartisanship, his long reign was marked by peace in the country that was lost afterwards.\n\nIn 1973, while Zahir Shah was undergoing medical treatment in Italy, his regime was overthrown in a coup d'etat by his cousin and former prime minister, Mohammed Daoud Khan, who established a single-party republic, ending more than 225 years of continuous monarchical government.\n\nZahir Shah is the best suiting candidate to revive a monarchist Afghanistan and to prolong his family's claim to the throne."
