 #History
 AFG_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Since the communists took power in 1978, Afghanistan has been in a state of civil war and external intervention and invasion. the withdrawal of the Soviet Union in 1989 and the fall of the communist regime in 1992 did not bring peace, but rather the conflict of interests between the mujahideen factions led to continued fighting between the factions until 1996 when the Pakistani-backed Taliban took advantage of the civil war between the major factions to seize Kabul and large parts of Afghanistan. Although the warring factions were still in conflict, the Taliban's goal was to eliminate all the factions, forcing the formerly warring factions to form a northern alliance against the Taliban under the mediation of General Massoud. A large number of civilians were harmed by war crimes in the endless war. What does the future hold for this war-torn country?"
 AFG_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "With the help of the coalition forces, the Northern Alliance successfully toppled the Taliban regime. Instead of being annihilated, the Taliban have fragmented and started waging an insurgency in various parts of Afghanistan, posing a significant threat to coalition and government forces. While some actions of coalition forces is one of the reasons for the Taliban's growth, the inefficiency and corruption of the government and Afghanistan's unique pre-modern tribal culture are the main reasons why the Taliban are difficult to annihilate, not to mention the fact that Taliban militants can hide and regroup in parts of Pakistan and go back to fight in Afghanistan. Will the government forces end the Taliban insurgency? Or there will be a peace deal to convince the Taliban to peacefully lay down their arms and join the government?"
