 ### Panamanian Events ###
#  panama.1.t: "Panama's Canal Handover"
#  panama.1.t: "A New Dawn for Panama"
#  panama.1.d: "As the clock strikes midnight, Panama enters the 21st century fully sovereign over its Canal and former U.S. bases, yet still grappling with lingering economic inequality and fragile democratic institutions; the country stands at a crossroads—poised to leverage its strategic geography, booming service economy, and regional ties while confronting challenges of corruption, social unrest, and the need for infrastructural renewal as you assume leadership on this pivotal first day of 2000."
#  panama.1.a: "We look forward to a new, sovereign century."

 panama.1.t: "The Shadow of Manuel Noriega"
 panama.1.d: "Manuel Noriega, the former military leader of Panama, is being held in prison abroad. Our advisors feel that it could help bring closure to the Panamanian people if we were to extradite him back to Panama. This would allow him to face justice for his crimes and potentially help heal the wounds of the past."
 panama.1.a: "Let's see that he faces justice in Panama."
 panama.1.b: "We must move on as a nation."
 panama.2.t: "Noriega Arrives in Panama"
 panama.2.d: "Manuel Noriega has arrived in Panama after being extradited from abroad. His return is a significant moment for the nation, as it allows for a reckoning with the past and the opportunity to address the legacy of his controversial rule." # The government must now decide how to handle his presence and the potential impact on national unity."
 panama.2.a: "Welcome him back. And let him face justice."
 panama.3.t: "Noriega Reinstated as General of the Panamanian Defense Force"
 panama.3.d: "Manuel Noriega has been reinstated as General of the Panamanian Defense Force, a move that has sparked controversy and debate within the nation. His return to a position of power raises questions about the future of Panama's defense policies and the potential implications for national unity and stability."
 panama.3.a: "Time will tell what this means for Panama."
 panama.4.t: "Military Junta Ousts Panama's President"
 panama.4.d: "The military junta, led by General Manuel Noriega, has ousted Panama's democratically elected president in a coup. This move has plunged the nation into uncertainty and raised concerns about the future of democracy in Panama. The junta's actions have been met with widespread condemnation from the international community, and the situation remains tense as the country grapples with the implications of this power grab."
 panama.4.a: "Is this the end of democracy in Panama?"
 panama.5.t: "Noriega is Dead"
 panama.5.d: "This somber morning, news spread across Panama's barracks and city streets that Manuel Noriega has succumbed to a long battle with cancer, leaving his iron-grip regime without its figurehead; within hours, the highest-ranking officers of the Panama Defense Forces sealed the palace gates, declared a state of emergency, and installed a provisional military tribunal to prevent chaos—vowing that, in the coming days, they would decide whether to consolidate under a new strongman, restore a semblance of civilian rule, or forge an entirely different path."
 panama.5.a: "We need to find our path forward, fast."
 panama.6.t: "Panama's Future"
 panama.6.d: "We cannot wait any longer to make our decision. We have in front of us, a few options:\nGeneral Rubén Darío Paredes, the former Commander of the National Guard and briefly Panama's de facto leader in 1982–83, commands deep loyalty among the officer corps and offers institutional continuity to stabilize the country.\nRaoul Cédras, the hard-line former head of the military junta in 1990–94, brings decisive toughness and an iron-fist approach capable of swiftly restoring order.\nColonel Roberto Díaz Herrera, Noriega's erstwhile Chief of Operations, is respected for his professionalism and counter-insurgency expertise, making him a credible choice to rebuild disciplined security forces.\nAlternatively, recognizing the sacrifices of the past, we may seize this moment to restore democracy and call fresh elections, returning power to civilian rule."
 panama.6.a: "General Rubén Darío Paredes"
 panama.6.b: "Colonel Roberto Díaz Herrera"
 panama.6.c: "Raoul Cédras"
 panama.6.e: "Let us call elections once more."
 panama.7.t: "The 2004 Elections"
 panama.7.d: "As President Moscoso's term ends in controversy, Panama prepares for a high-stakes contest that will determine its political and economic direction; four starkly different visions vie for the isthmus, from Torrijos's center-left renewal to Endara's promise of clean government, Martinelli's business-first agenda, and Sousa Batista's radical socialist overhaul."

 panama.8.d: "With the government announcing plans to allow renewed U.S. military access to former bases, thousands of students, labor unionists, and leftist groups have take to the streets in mass protests, decrying the move as a violation of national sovereignty; this unrest fans the flames of communist, non-aligned, and nationalist sentiment, weakening pro-Western parties and emboldening calls for an independent defense policy."

 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 MIREYA_MOSCOSO_DESC: "Mireya Moscoso is a Panamanian politician who served as the first female President of Panama from 1999 to 2004. She is a member of the Arnulfista Party and was the widow of former President Arnulfo Arias. Moscoso's presidency was marked by efforts to improve education, healthcare, and infrastructure in Panama. She also focused on strengthening Panama's sovereignty after the U.S. handover of the Panama Canal. However, her administration faced criticism for corruption and mismanagement, leading to a decline in public support towards the end of her term."
 MARTIN_TORRIJOS_DESC: "Martín Torrijos was fathered out of wedlock by Panamanian military ruler Omar Torrijos, the de facto head of Panama from 1968 to 1981. He was educated in economics and political science in the United States. He then returned to Panama, becoming active in the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). He was the party's presidential candidate in the 1999 general election, losing to Arnulfista Coalition candidate Mireya Moscoso."
 GUILLERMO_ENDARA_DESC: "Guillermo Endara, Panama's first post-invasion president (1990-1994), returns as the Solidarity Party candidate on a platform of anti-corruption, judicial reform, and bolstering public security, pledging to restore trust in government and uphold democratic institutions."
 RICARDO_MARTINELLI_DESC: "Ricardo Martinelli, a billionaire entrepreneur and former Canal Affairs minister, ran for office promising aggressive pro-business reforms, major infrastructure projects, and tax incentives to jump-start economic growth while positioning himself as a pragmatic outsider who can break the political mold."
 RUBEN_DARIO_SOUSA_BATISTA_DESC: "Rubén Darío Sousa Batista, long-time General Secretary of the People's Party, champions a radical left-wing agenda of nationalizing key industries, expanding social welfare programs, and empowering workers' cooperatives to eradicate poverty and inequality."
 MANUEL_NORIEGA_DESC: "Manuel Noriega is a Panamanian politician and military officer who served as the de facto ruler of Panama from 1983 to 1989. He was a controversial figure, known for his authoritarian rule and close ties to the United States, which later turned against him. Noriega's regime was marked by corruption, human rights abuses, and drug trafficking. In 1989, he was ousted by a U.S. invasion and subsequently imprisoned in the United States for drug trafficking and racketeering."
 RUBEN_DARIO_PAREDES_DESC: "A career soldier who rose to prominence as Commander of the National Guard in 1982-83, Paredes briefly served as Panama's de facto head of state before civilian rule was restored. Known for his calm demeanor and institutional loyalty, he revamped training and discipline within the Guard, earning respect from junior officers and civilians alike. Paredes emerged from retirement in 2017 to reunite fractious military factions under his steady hand, prioritizing stability and gradual reforms over radical change. His leadership style combines cautious pragmatism with a deep commitment to preserving Panama's security apparatus."
 ROBERTO_DIAZ_HERRERA_DESC: "A seasoned tactician who served as Noriega's Chief of Operations in the 1980s, Díaz Herrera earned acclaim for his expertise in counter-insurgency and covert coordination, yet later distanced himself from the regime's worst excesses. Revered by fellow officers for his professionalism and cool under pressure, he cultivated a reputation as a hands-on field commander who valued precision and accountability. Since Noriega passed, Díaz Herrera has stepped forward as a unifying figure capable of overhauling Panama's security forces into a lean, disciplined institution. His leadership is marked by strategic acumen, respect for the rule of military protocol, and a cautious openness to limited civilian oversight."
 RAOUL_CEDRAS_DESC: "Raoul Cédras is a Haitian former military officer who led a coup against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991, governing Haiti as the head of its military junta until 1994, before going into exile in Panama under diplomatic asylum. While long divorced from direct Panamanian affairs, he retained strong ties to retired military circles and hardline supporters who believed his return would revive discipline and firm control. Known in Haiti for ruthless suppression of dissent and iron-fisted tactics, Cédras brings an uncompromising, authoritarian approach to the junta in Panama. His experience in staging coups and maintaining power makes him a formidable, if feared, contender to lead following Noriega's death."
