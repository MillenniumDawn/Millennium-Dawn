  CHI_End_PLA_Business_Ventures_desc:0 "In order to make up for defence budget cuts, the country’s military, the PLA, started acquiring business ventures in the 1970s. However the government has recently started to become concerned by this phenomenon. A new directive to remove the PLA from most sectors of the economy is therefore necessary, but in order to placate the military we must implement this alongside an increase in the budget."

  CHI_Future_of_the_CPC_desc:0 "As much as the Communist Party of China likes to present itself as a strong, united entity, it is not immune to fissures along factional lines. We must choose which, if any faction we desire to favour."

  CHI_End_Class_Warfare_desc:0 "As a result of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents Thought”, the foundations of Chinese political thought have been substantially, if subtly amended. While Mao’s underlying ideology relied on class warfare in favour of the rural peasants against the urban bourgeoisie, Jiang’s more pro-business orientation has led him to favour an end to this aspect of Chinese governance."

  CHI_Peaceful_Rise:0 "China's Peaceful Rise"
  CHI_Peaceful_Rise_desc:0 "The perception of China as a threat to international peace and security is not uncommon in the US and amongst our neighbours. To counter this, we should adopt the official policy of “China’s peaceful rise” or, to put it in an even less threatening way, “China’s peaceful development”. This will assure our Western and regional partners that we do not seek conflict."

  CHI_Scientific_Outlook_on_Development_desc:0 "In many ways a backlash by Hu Jintao against the growth-centric focus of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, the “Scientific Outlook on Development” is the theoretical underpinning of Hu’s government, one that focuses on sustainable growth that minimizes environmental pollution and socioeconomic inequality."

  CHI_Green_GDP_desc:0 "A key tenet of the scientific outlook on development is sustainability.

  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Agenda_desc:0 "The strengthening of the Shanghai Clique has paved the way for Jiang Zemin’s so-called “hatchet man” to assume leadership of the Communist Party and the nation.

  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Thought_desc:0 "Building upon Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, Zeng has formulated a new ideological underpinning for the CPC, one that stresses the duty of the party to represent the majority of Chinese people.

  CHI_Intra_Party_Democracy_desc:0 "One of Zeng Qinghong’s key ideas is that of intra-party democracy, in which elections are used to select local-level party secretaries.

  CHI_Public_Examinations_desc:0 "In order to fill the Communist Party apparatus with the most competent officials possible, Zeng has ordered that all lower-level posts should be filled through rigorous public examinations rather than by appointment.

  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Agenda:0 "Xi Jinping's Agenda"
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Agenda_desc:0 "With Bo Xilai out of the way, the path is clear for a smooth transition of power to vice-president Xi Jinping.

  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Thought:0 "Xi Jinping Thought"
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Thought_desc:0 "Xi Jinping's contribution to the theoretical basis of the CPC's rule is one that establishes a large number of lofty goals for the party.

  CHI_Flowing_Spring:0 "Flowing Spring"
  CHI_Flowing_Spring_desc:0 "Taking his Chinese Dream to the next level, Xi Jinping has drawn on a poem from the 8th century BCE entitled "Flowing Spring" which concerns regaining greatness and prosperity.

  CHI_Anti_Corruption_Campaigns_desc:0 "The time has come for us to start securing our grip on power. Many political rivals of [CHI.GetLeader] remain politically active and constitute a threat, however slim, to our government.

  CHI_Weaken_the_Youth_League_desc:0 "The populist coalition headed by the Tuanpai or Youth League Faction retains significant influence due to the significant degree of independence possessed by the Communist Youth League. By reducing this independence and conducting bribery investigations against Youth League members such as Ling Jihua, we can make the Youth League cease to be an important force in Chinese politics."

  CHI_Take_Down_the_Big_Tigers_desc:0 "The elitist coalition, dominated by "princelings" and Jiang Zemin's Shanghai clique, retains a large number of high-ranking posts in the CPC. Luckily for us, a large number of this officials are involved in corruption due to the nepotism of Jiang Zemin's government.

  CHI_War_on_Crime:0 "War on Crime"
  CHI_War_on_Crime_desc:0 "During his time as Party secretary of Chongqing, Bo Xilai made fighting organized crime one of his top priorities. Now that he can extend his method of governing to the entire country, it is high time that the corrupt businessmen and triad bosses in the rest of the country meet the same fates as their Chongqing-based brethren."
  CHI_The_Chongqing_Model:0 "The Chongqing Model"
  CHI_The_Chongqing_Model_desc:0 "The Chongqing Model is Bo Xilai's contribution to Communist Party doctrine. It is a model that includes a wide range of social and economic policies, including "strike black" and "sing red" campaigns that involve fighting organized crime and singing communist songs respectively.

  CHI_JASIC_Labor_Reforms_desc:0 "Labor disputes are a significant hinderance to the government's legitimacy. Workers at Jasic Technology in particular have sought to unionize in order to fight for their rights.

  CHI_Humanist_Marxism:0 "Humanist Marxism"
  CHI_Humanist_Marxism_desc:0 "The "New Left" ideology put forward by Bo Xilai and others is one that favours a return to aspects of Maoist socialism such as state-planning and collectivism. Now that he has come to power, Bo can pursue his leftist agenda under the banner of "humanist marxism"."
  CHI_Nanjie_Model:0 "The Nanjie Model"
  CHI_Nanjie_Model_desc:0 "In many ways a development of the Chongqing model, the Nanjie model retains many elements of Bo's original theory but draws on the example of Nanjie village, a stronghold of Maoism that retains a collectivist system. Bo's Nanjie model calls on China to heed Nanjie's example, and leave behind capitalism and the free-market in favour of true socialism."
  CHI_Purge_Tuanpai:0 "Purge the Tuanpai"

  CHI_Promote_Princelings_desc:0 "While the venerable members of Jiang Zemin's Shanghai clique have served China well, it is time for them to retire and make way for a new generation of leaders.

  CHI_Bo_Xilai_Agenda:0 "Bo Xilai's Agenda"
  CHI_Bo_Xilai_Agenda_desc:0 "Following the rise to power of the princelings and the political chaos that followed the purge of the Youth League faction, Bo Xilai has managed to come out on top by distinguishing himself from his fellow princelings with his ardent "New Left" ideology. Bo will now be free to pursue his somewhat controversial vision for Chinese politics."
  CHI_Scrap_Military_Commands:0 "Scrap Military Commands"
  CHI_Scrap_Military_Commands_desc:0 "The PLA's seven military commands are overly cumbersome and would hinder the ability of different units to coordinate in the event of a large-scale conflict. To remedy this, we should regroup these military commands into four strategic zones: North, South, East and West. However, this change will not come without consequences, as many military officers will resist this disruption."
  CHI_Cut_Ground_Troop_Numbers:0 "Cut Ground Troop Numbers"
  CHI_Cut_Ground_Troop_Numbers_desc:0 "Quantity is not an issue for the PLA, but quality is. Moreover, the PLA Ground Forces dwarf the other arms of the military, meaning we are burdened with an overly landlocked, cumbersome force. In order to make our military more mobile, nimble, and responsive, we should reduce our reliance on the ground forces by cutting troop numbers."
  CHI_Stamp_Out_Corruption:0 "Stamp Out Corruption"
  CHI_Stamp_Out_Corruption_desc:0 "One of the biggest hurdles to making the PLA a modern military on par with those of the West is corruption. We should use the Central Military Commission to crackdown on any signs of corruption that we can find."

  CHI_De_Politicize_the_Military_desc:0 "While the PLA's loyalty to the CPC ensures the security and stability of our one-party state, it is undeniable that this politicization of the military has, at least in part, diminished the ability of the PLA to function as an effective war-fighting force."

  CHI_Let_a_Hundred_Flowers_Bloom_desc:0 "In 1956, Mao Zedong initiated the Hundred Flowers Campaign, calling for Chinese citizens to openly air their grievances towards the government. While that campaign ended in repression and a return to the status quo, a reboot of the same campaign does not necessarily have to end the same way."
  CHI_Freedom_of_Speech:0 "Freedom of Speech"

  CHI_Question_the_Four_Cardinal_Principles_desc:0 "Deng Xiaoping's Four Cardinal Principles included upholding the socialist path, the people's democratic dictatorship, the leadership of the CPC and Maozedong thought. The inclusion of these principles means that debate about the nature of authoritarian rule in China has not been allowed. If our country is to progress, this should be amended to help diversify debate on China's future."

  CHI_Unchain_the_8_Democratic_Parties_desc:0 "While the Communist Party dominates Chinese politics, 8 other legal parties exist as part of the country's political system. However, up until now they have had little influence over policy and lack an independent voice.

  CHI_Return_of_the_Dalai_Lama_desc:0 "Tibet has been a source of great concern for our regime in the past few decades. While we have historically dealt with the issue by means of censorship and repression, it may be better for our authority in the province if we were seen to grant concessions to the Tibetan people. One of the greatest concessions we could possibly make is to allow for the return of the Dalai Lama."

  CHI_Declassify_the_Turkistan_Islamic_Party:0 "While we may be unwilling to negotiate with a terrorist group, we should not let this unwillingness stand in the way of achieving peace. Offering to legitimize the Turkistan Islamic Party as a political force in Xinjiang subject to changes in its ideology and message will go a long way towards reaching that all-important goal of peace."

  CHI_One_China_Policy_desc:0 "As the world's largest country by population and fourth largest by landmass, it is no wonder that there are those who wish for greater degrees of autonomy within our republic. We should consider whether to hold the country together at all costs or to grant space for autonomy within our one China."
  CHI_Two_Systems:0 "Two Systems"
  CHI_Two_Systems_desc:0 "While most of China can still conform to our existing form of governance, we should keep to Deng Xiaoping's "One Country Two Systems" principle and allow certain parts of China to maintain their own unique political, economic, and legal systems.

  CHI_The_NPCSC_Decision_on_Hong_Kong_desc:0 "China's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has a decision to make regarding the extent of electoral reform we can grant Hong Kong. Giving the S.A.R. universal suffrage will appease the democracy movement's demands but increase the risk of an anti-Chinese or separatist leader gaining control of Hong Kong while refusing universal suffrage could lead to mass protests."

  CHI_Hong_Kong_Future_desc:0 "We have so far made no indication as to the fate of Hong Kong when the Basic Law preserving its current autonomy expires in 2047. It may be in our interest to do so now as promising a continuation of its autonomy could help convince Taiwan to return to our control. On the other hand, we might want to quash separatism by showing the inevitability of every Chinese territory's return to our control."
  CHI_Greater_Tibetan_Autonomy:0 "Greater Tibetan Autonomy"
  CHI_Greater_Tibetan_Autonomy_desc:0 "Tibet is a region with a unique cultural and religious identity. While we must continue to regard it as an integral part of the Chinese nation, it may serve our purposes to grant a greater degree of self-rule to the Tibetans than they currently possess."

However, if we cut our losses now and amend our policy towards Taiwan we will still be able to keep Taiwan within our sphere of influence. A good first step will be to recognize their sovereignty."
