 GER_renewable_energies_law_desc: "Its predecessor from 1991 made an big step towards an greener future, but renewable energies like solar energies or wind turbines are still not economically reasonable.

 GER_reform_ministry_agriculture_desc: "For many years the ministry had the word 'Forst' (forest) in it, but its significancy dropped massively over the years. Instead the topics of data and consumer protection became more important. Reforming the ministry should help it to tackle its future tasks"

 GER_reform_bafog_desc: "Originally intended to help the students to pay there studium, the former government under chancelor Kohl 'reformed' the fund in such a way, that it became too unatractive for students to apply for it at all.

 GER_forbid_npd_desc: "Often seen as the follower of the NSDAP in terms of ideology, the NPD is an ultranationalist party in the far right spectrum.\nSadly in the recent past, attacks against foreigners and other minorities in Germany such as gay couples increased again.

 GER_conservative_ties_to_the_automotive_industry: "CDU Ties to the Automotive Industry"
 GER_conservative_ties_to_the_automotive_industry_desc: "While the Christian conservative CDU/CSU is not as deeply connected to the automotive industry as Gerhard Schröder is with Volkswagen, several important German car manufacturers are still located in predominantly conservative states in the south, notably Porsche and Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg and BMW in Munich, Bavaria."
 GER_automotive_investments_in_europe: "Automotive Investments in Europe"
 GER_automotive_investments_in_europe_desc: "By aggressively pushing into other European markets, German car manufacturers could drastically reduce their personnel costs by leaving German industry and thus German wages behind in favor of European Union member states with lower standards of living.

 GER_strengthen_volkswagen: "Strengthen Volkswagen"
 GER_strengthen_volkswagen_desc: "The German Ministry of Finance found that 30% of jobs in Lower Saxony are either directly provided by or indirectly dependent on Volkswagen, the largest company in Germany and Germany's main corporate applicant of soft power abroad.

 GER_the_kaluga_plant_desc: "Some 150 kilometers southeast of Russia's capital Moscow and located on the regional Oka River, Kaluga in the Kaluga Oblast has been identified by the Volkswagen group as a potential good fit to build VW or Audi models. This Kaluga plant could employ over 5,000 Russians at wages far lower than the automotive giants would have to pay to Germans."
 GER_the_aurangabad_plant: "The Aurangabad Plant"
 GER_the_aurangabad_plant_desc: "India is a large untapped market for the Volkswagen group. Whereas German cars are smash hits in China already, more time and marketing is needed to get the people of India, the second most populous country on earth, on board. If German companies don't act fast, Indian ones will soon pop up to fill the niche as more Indians move into economic brackets able to afford vehicles."
 GER_expand_volkswagen_into_china: "Expand Volkswagen into China"
 GER_expand_volkswagen_into_china_desc: "While the Chinese already buy Volkswagen cars, more can be done to get the company to employ Chinese laborers in the People's Republic itself. By making the government there dependent on Volkswagen's investments and labor provisions, the German market influence in China would increase drastically. The planned factories in Chengdu, Shanghai and Liaoning could easily employ tens of thousands."
 GER_dresden_and_leipzig_factories: "Dresden and Leipzig Manufacturies"
 GER_dresden_and_leipzig_factories_desc: "While it will be profitable to outsource Volkswagen jobs, it'll not make the homegrown population of automotive laborers particularly happy. In the traditional heavy labor hub that is the state of Saxony, Volkswagen plans new high skill factories - they will need a few government subsidies and tax cuts to make the project profitable, however."
 GER_seize_opposition_weakness: "Seize Opposition Weakness"
 GER_seize_opposition_weakness_desc: "With the Möllermann crisis in the FDP and the corruption scandal in the CDU/CSU, the opposition to Gerhard Schröder's SPD (red) and Joschka Fischer's Greens, who together form the government as the 'red-green coalition', is weaker than ever. This comes at an opportune moment, as the year 1999 had held several weak electoral results for the governing parties, even in traditionally left-leaning states."
 GER_utilize_spd_influence_in_lower_saxony: "Utilize SPD Influence in Lower Saxony"
 GER_utilize_spd_influence_in_lower_saxony_desc: "Historically, the German Social Democrats, the SPD, played second fiddle to the much stronger CDU/CSU, the 'Union'. Only in 1998 did Gerhard Schröder dethrone four-term incumbent Helmut Kohl of the CDU. Schröder's power base lies in his home in Lower Saxony, one of the most loyal SPD voting states that is also home to Germany's largest company, Volkswagen, a political ally of Schröder."
 GER_infrastructural_reform: "Infrastructural Reform"
 GER_infrastructural_reform_desc: "Because of a brewing political crisis involving Minister of Infrastructure Reinhard Klimmt and his associated football club, 1. FC Saarbrücken, Klimmt should be replaced with a new Federal Minister for Traffic, Construction and Housing. Kurt Bodewig would be a worthwhile replacement."
 GER_coal_industry_compromise: "Coal Industry Compromise"
 GER_coal_industry_compromise_desc: "While SPD and Greens were united in their opposition to the liberal decisionmaking of the Union and the FDP, the downfall of Oskar Lafontaine in 1999 and the rise of Schröder's Clintonite ideology presented a clear dissonance between Greens and SPD: Whereas Fischer seeks to eliminate fossil fuel usage, the SPD wants to preserve laborers in the industry. The main conflict has always been brown coal."
 GER_foreign_policy_pragmatism: "Foreign Policy Pragmatism"
 GER_foreign_policy_pragmatism_desc: "The Schröder government has made several severe miscalculations during its first two years in office. The chancellor's push for a permanent German seat on the UN Security Council combined with a half-hearted attempt to pursue European Federalism, both of which alienated Germany's closest European partner, France. SPD and Greens need to realized the error of their ways."
 GER_limited_haushaltskonsolidierung: "Limited Budget Consolidation"
 GER_limited_haushaltskonsolidierung_desc: "One of the Schröder administration's primary goals in office, the Haushaltskonsolidierung, 'budget consolidation', is not going to happen. The budget has kept bloating under social democratic leadership and private debt keeps growing on both a per capita and a per household basis. All Germany can do now is to introduce limited budget cuts in areas like defense spending to minimize the damage."
 GER_green_card_initiative: "Green Card Initiative"
 GER_green_card_initiative_desc: "Inspired by American and Canadian immigration programs, the Schröder government has proposed the introduction of a 'Green-Card-Initiative' to quickly assemble foreign IT workers to accerelate the development of Germany's underdeveloped high-technology sector. The Kohl government before Schröder had neglected both internet and IT development, and this needs to be amended."
 GER_pension_reform: "Pension Reform"
 GER_pension_reform_desc: "One of the key talking points of the German social democrats against German conservatives has always been the size of pensions, and the electoral battle between Schröder and Kohl in 1998 was no different. Should the Schröder administration fail to at least provide token relief to Germany's elderly, the SPD's prestige among the working class would collapse utterly."
 GER_digitalized_education_system: "Digitalized Education System"
 GER_digitalized_education_system_desc: "One of Schröder's core promises during the 1998 campaign was 'Schulen ans Netz', 'schools onto the web', referring to the low rate of internet access and digitalization among German elementary and even high schools during the Kohl Administration. Seeing the 'Schulen ans Netz' program succeed would be costly, but hugely beneficial to Germany's pupils."
 GER_scientific_exchanges: "Scientific Exchanges"
 GER_scientific_exchanges_desc: "With foreign experts flocking to Germany to live and work in tech and start-up hubs like Cologne and Berlin, Germany's innovativeness has improved. To former formalize these exchanges, German research teams must regularly meet up with foreign colleagues to study and compare results."
 GER_improved_federal_education_standards: "Improved Federal Education Standards"
 GER_improved_federal_education_standards_desc: "In Germany, the concept of \"Bildungshoheit der Länder\", the 'state supremacy in education', takes away federal control of education policy and allows individual states to more autonomously set their own goals. The downside of this system is that some states' education like NRW and Bremen have fallen in prestige and standard behind that of states like Bavaria. This can be amended by federal minimums."
 GER_international_business: "International Business"
 GER_international_business_desc: "Germany often hails itself \"Exportweltmeister\", 'world champion of exports'. The German economy has traditionally seen significant trade surplusses, selling far more to other industrial nations than Germany itself purchases from them. A continuation of an export-friendly policy requires great amounts of foreign political pragmatism - the money of a dictator is just as good as the money of a popular leader, after all."
 GER_sino_german_deals: "Sino-German Deals"
 GER_sino_german_deals_desc: "Germany punches far above its weight when it comes to its export economy. The only country that comes anywhere close is the People's Republic of China, which sports more than 20 times the German population to power its insatiable economic engine. China is desperate for any way to power and more growth - the Chinese want German machines, German cars and the know-how of German companies."
 GER_oil_trade_negotiations: "Oil Trade Negotiations"
 GER_oil_trade_negotiations_desc: "The German petroleum supply is one of the country's most pressing emergencies. Germany's oil sources are diverse - Norway, Nigeria, Libya, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Scotland. Germany operates on all continents to gain and secure access to valuable resources."
 GER_nord_stream: "Nord Stream"
 GER_nord_stream_desc: "Schröder is notoriously friendly to Vladimir Putin, Russia's autocrat. The Russo-German trade relations revolve around Russian natural resources and their usage in Germany. Russian gas giant Gazprom has a plan to bypass Ukrainian and Polish oversight by getting Russian gas straight into Germany through a pipeline in the Baltic, \"Nord Stream\". This plan is great for German profits, but Eastern Europe won't like it."
 GER_appease_eastern_europe: "Appease Eastern Europe"
 GER_appease_eastern_europe_desc: "Our investments into Nord Stream pose a significant threat to Polish, Slovak, Czech and Ukrainian trade and transit profits regarding Russian oil delivered to Germany and the rest of western Europe. We have to trade the line carefully now, as to avoid completely alienating our reliable partners. Russia is not trustworthy enough to make that trade off worthwhile."
 GER_accomodate_polish_migrant_workers: "Accomodate Polish Migrant Workers"
 GER_accomodate_polish_migrant_workers_desc: "Polish labor migration into Germany goes back far in history - the 'Ruhr Poles' for example are a population of ethnic Poles in the Ruhr area that immigrated during the 19th Century to work as coal miners. Most recently, Germany and Poland signed a neighbor treaty in 1991. Hundreds of thousands of Poles enter Germany as seasonal workers every year, particularly in agriculture."
 GER_russo_german_partnership: "Russo-German Partnership"
 GER_russo_german_partnership_desc: "Polish defense minister Radoslaw Sikorski already likened our new business deals with the Russians to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It is clear that our critics are incorrect about the Poles and their friends being more reliable than the Russians - they too are just out to backstab us at an opportune moment. Russia is a worthy partner that needs to be maintained."
 GER_closer_integration_with_eaeu_markets: "Closer Integration with EAEU Markets"
 GER_closer_integration_with_eaeu_markets_desc: "The Eastern European Union is Russia's (rather poor) imitation of the EU's economic compacts. Their problem is that they really don't have the economic power to back their economic ambitions - but German cooperation might help them with that."
 GER_expand_the_rhine_route: "Expand the Rhine Route"
 GER_expand_the_rhine_route_desc: "The Rhine is the most heavily used trade river in Europe and is the shared pride of the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, France and Switzerland. Germany and the Netherlands depend on each other to maximize the trade potential."
 GER_strengthen_ties_to_belgium: "Strengthen Ties to Belgium"
 GER_strengthen_ties_to_belgium_desc: "After closing the ranks with our Dutch neighbors, we need to also aggressively push our companies into the Belgian market. German influence on Belgium and Belgian dependence upon Germany will be essential for any future conflict between the two nations regarding the outdated nuclear power plant at Tihange, one of the primary threats to German national security."
 GER_trans_atlantic_trade: "Trans-Atlantic Trade"
 GER_trans_atlantic_trade_desc: "By investing in the \"Deutsch-Amerikanische Handelskammern\" ('German American Chambers of Commerce'), the German economy could increase its bilateral ties to the markets in the United States, particularly by tailoring high-end German goods to the needs of American industry. That would serve both the German role as an export nation and the American role as an import nation."
 GER_trade_with_canada: "Trade with Canada"
 GER_trade_with_canada_desc: "Canada holds several key strengths as a trade partner: Abundance of natural resources, a highly educated workforce, strong pre-existing ties to Europe - and a huge dependency on a single country that they'd like to diversify away from. We have to find the hidden gears that could get a German-Canadian trade deal to function."
 GER_schroeder_ii: "Schröder II"
 GER_schroeder_ii_desc: "After assuming a first term as chancellor in 1998, Schröder has won several resounding political victories. The CDU and FDP crises regarding Kohl and Möllermann, respectively, have greatly diminished the conservatives' chances to win the election. Schröder's run for reelection could however still need some campaign boosts - like declining to join American wars of aggression."
 GER_auffangbank_concept: "'Auffangbank' Concept"
 GER_auffangbank_concept_desc: "Inspired by American Resolution Trust Corporations, or RTCs, the Schröder administration has brianstormed the creation of a German 'bad bank'-esque financial institute to predict and avoid future financial crises. But that would never happen, now would it?"
 GER_back_deutsche_bank: "Back Deutsche Bank"
 GER_back_deutsche_bank_desc: "Deutsche Bank (DB) is by far the largest bank in Germany, spanning almost 100,000 employees, over 2,500 outlets and scoring incomes of 1.6 billion Euros a year, more than triple that of their closest rivals, DZ Bank, KfW and Commerzbank, all of whom make about 500 million Euros. DB is central to the German banking system - although we should be careful to not have it involved in Russian corruption."
 GER_homegrown_software: "Homegrown Software"
 GER_homegrown_software_desc: "With the 'Schulen ans Netz' program in full effect, the funds should now also be diverted towards German multimedia companies like Nuremberg-based SoftMaker to develop utility and office programs to dissuade American-made software at the workplace. The German government could also subsidize the acquisition of licenses for such programs to double the incentive."
 GER_the_internet_neuland: "The Internet 'Neuland'"
 GER_the_internet_neuland_desc: "In an infamous speech on 19 June 2013, then Chancellor Angela Merkel explained that the internet 'is new territory for us all', although more than 95% of the German population by then had connection to the internet and more than half used it regularly. Merkel's comments were in a long line of conservative mishaps in internet policies - the slow speed of German internet connection goes back all the way to Kohl."
 GER_agenda_2010: "Agenda 2010"
 GER_agenda_2010_desc: "Gerhard Schröder was always a moderate among the social democrats and thus advocated restraint with the budget. The 'Agenda 2010' is an ambitious project of budget cuts and bureaucratic reforms that will without a doubt draw heavy criticism from leftist groups and push the government towards the center - but it could be fantastic for economic progress."
 GER_sports_funding: "Sports Funding"
 GER_sports_funding_desc: "In German politics, it usually proves very effective to generate domestic profit as well as political capital by funding and supporting sporting projects, particularly football stadiums."
 GER_hartz_iv: "Hartz IV"
 GER_hartz_iv_desc: "The 'Commission for Modern Services at the Labor Market', called the 'Hartz Commission' for its leader Peter Hartz, had to develop a new concept for the service market, categorized as Hartz I through Hartz IV. Hartz IV in particular, the new ruling on unemployment benefits, stands heavily against classical social democratic values and will garner heavy criticism from traditional SPD voters."
 GER_sonderparteitag: "Sonderparteitag"
 GER_sonderparteitag_desc: "Since Lafontaine's withdrawal, Schröder's support among left-wing forces in Germany has been waning. Juggling the interests of employers and employees, of unions and corporations, of the economy and the working class has been controversial, to say the least. Gerhard Schröder, to save face, must now pass party leadership to fully focus on his office as Federal Chancellor."
 GER_vertrauensfrage: "Vertrauensfrage"
 GER_vertrauensfrage_desc: "Schröder has been unable to keep the Greens in line and his own SPD behind him. His primary way of enforcing his own policies has been to threaten his resignation and to thus threaten the remaining stability of the coalition. Now, with public support definitely gone, it is time to call a vote of confidence, a 'Vertrauensfrage'. Schröder fully intends to lose this vote and to call for immediate reelections."
 GER_schroeder_iii: "Schröder III"
 GER_schroeder_iii_desc: "The political power move has worked: Schröder secures his third term as Federal Chancellor and can now assemble a new coalition, either with the neoliberal FDP or the progressive Greens. Both the leftist PDS and the conservative CDU/CSU are unlikely to approve of this result and will continue hard-fought opposition to SPD policy."
 GER_gewerkschaftsgesetz: "Gewerkschaftsgesetz"
 GER_gewerkschaftsgesetz_desc: "The traditionally close relationship between the SPD and Germany's powerful labor unions will once more show itself with the passage of Schröder's Gewerkschaftsgesetz, a piece of legislation that will grant striking workers even greater autonomy and protection from the employer's attempts to cut strikes short. Critically, the law would pass almost all decisions as to strike ends to respective governments."
 GER_regions_of_innovation: "Regions of Innovation"
 GER_regions_of_innovation_desc: "Championed by the SPD electoral program of 2005, the Schröder government promised the reduction of bureaucracy and waiting periods as part of the 'Innovationsregionen' promise. These Regions of Innovation should greatly lessen the burden of daily life on the working class individual, even though a restriction of bureaucracy through spending cuts would likely bring conflict with the Greens."
 GER_trust_in_germany: "Trust in Germany"
 GER_trust_in_germany_desc: "The SPD aggressively led its reelection bid for Gerhard Schröder's third term as Federal Chancellor with the slogan \"Vertrauen in Deutschland\", 'Trust in Germany'. Playing to patriotic and communal feelings and connecting these energies with working class activism could be a real game winner for social democratic fervor - and for national unity against domestic and international obstacles."
 GER_further_union_reassurances: "Further Union Reassurances"
 GER_further_union_reassurances_desc: "After the successful passing of the Gewerkschaftsgesetz, the Schröder administration stands determined to forge a lasting and fruitful alliance with Germany's powerful labor unions, against international mega corporations and foreign investors."
 GER_anti_unemployment_efforts: "Anti-Unemployment Efforts"
 GER_anti_unemployment_efforts_desc: "Unemployment, \"Arbeitslosigkeit\" in German, is one of the primary antagonists that the social democrats of the SPD seek to fight against. Built on the 'Regions of Innovation' program, the SPD leadership has now put forward a wide range of 'employment guarantee' policies that could push down the unemployment by as much as half a percent of the German population."
 GER_pan_european_efforts: "Pan-European Efforts"
 GER_pan_european_efforts_desc: "Although Schröder's advances to establish a European Confederation under Franco-German leadership all but irritated Paris, with the reestablished and newly strengthened social democratic leadership, it must be seriously considered whether or not another advance on the European ideal would be out of the question."
 GER_close_ranks_with_the_international_unions: "Close Ranks with the International Unions"
 GER_close_ranks_with_the_international_unions_desc: "After reestablishing the labor unions as the dominant force in German public life, Germany needs to take a dominant stance in international labor organizations to enforce high-quality labor standards across Europe and then the world. As long as there are cheaper labor pools in the EU, the living standards of the German working class are threatened."

 GER_economic_prosperity_desc: "Growth! Growth! Growth!\nThe economy must groooooooow!"
 GER_continental_education_investments: "Continental Education Investments"
 GER_continental_education_investments_desc: "Taking inspiration from the EuRopean community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students (ERASMUS), the German government needs to take further steps to unite Europe's young people into a singular group of talent - a group that after their graduation would look at Germany for the highest possible wages for their careers."
 GER_return_to_old_social_democracy: "Return to Old Social Democracy"
 GER_return_to_old_social_democracy_desc: "If Willy Brandt was still alive, he'd rip Schröder's head off. The modern SPD has become too neoliberal, too friendly to megacorporations, and has drastically distanced itself from the working class. Some veterans of old school Social Democracy, like Helmut Schmidt and Oskar Lafontaine, are still around. Reintroducing themselves into politics might save the SPD after all."
 GER_brandtism: "Brandtism"
 GER_brandtism_desc: "Willy Brandt in the 1970s was a man of character: Worker-oriented, idealistic, anti-nationalistic, reformist, anti-communist. While a man like him will not be seen among German social democrats for another few centuries, returning to the roots of his philosophy is necessary to modernize a new and rejuvenated SPD."
 GER_european_leftism: "European Leftism"
 GER_european_leftism_desc: "Since the days Jean Jaures warned against a war between Europe's working peoples and died for it in 1914, the leftist movements across the continents have stood against nationalistic egomanias among the countries. We stand on the shoulders of giants - Jaures, Brandt, Schmidt, Walesa."
 GER_arbeiterstaat: "Arbeiterstaat"
 GER_arbeiterstaat_desc: "We have successfully created labor conditions that are worthy of our social democratic forefathers. Although economically still based in a capitalist market, our welfare state and employment efforts are now so complete that we can truly speak of a semi-socialist society, an 'Arbeiterstaat', workers' state."
 GER_heavy_industry_focus: "Heavy Industry Focus"
 GER_heavy_industry_focus_desc: "East Germany's downfall was partially caused by the socialists' early focus on heavy industry, whereas West Germany built a dynamic service industry. Now, building on that service industry, we can at last unleash Germany's ambitions to a strong and proud heavy industrial sector."
 GER_continue_the_third_way: "Continue the Third Way"
 GER_continue_the_third_way_desc: "The 'Third Way', championed by the likes of Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schröder, is a new style of social democracy. Liberal, pragmatic, business-oriented. Such a modernization was overdue and necessary to rescind the previous marxist leanings within European social democracy and bring it more in line with the American values of the Democratic Party as well as modern globalized neoliberals."
 GER_appeasement_in_eastern_europe: "Appeasement in Eastern Europe"
 GER_appeasement_in_eastern_europe_desc: "The Eastern Europeans, especially Poland and Ukraine, are REALLY annoyed with Nord Stream, as bypassing their pipelines gives the Russians leverage to blackmail Eastern European gas markets without threat of loss of Western European profits. We must make clear that, against this step backwards in our relations, we will stand firm with our commitments to our eastern partners."
 GER_non_aggression_principle_with_russia: "Non-Aggression Principle with Russia"
 GER_non_aggression_principle_with_russia_desc: "Between 1941 and 1945, Russia and Germany fought the most destructive conflict between any two nations in human history. Our two countries may never find themselves pitted against each other on the world's battlefields again."
 GER_break_with_putin: "Break with [SOV.GetLeader]"
 GER_break_with_putin_desc: "The Social Democrats have been uncomfortably close to Putin. The Russian President is not Germany's natural friend - and the SocDems must recognize this. Our political alliance with [SOV.GetLeader] must cease to exist."
 GER_seek_russias_favor: "Seek Russia's Favor"

 GER_international_non_alignment: "International Non-Alignment"
 GER_international_non_alignment_desc: "We must stay out of the world's conflict. If the Americans want to invade Iraq, they will have to do with us. That however does not mean we endorse Russian or Chinese authoritarians. Just stay out of our business, everybody. Germany will adopt a Swiss model of foreign policy."
 GER_angela_merkel: "Angela Merkel"
 GER_angela_merkel_desc: "With the lost Vertrauensfrage, Schröder's political capital and reputation with the German people was totally depleted. It was relatively easy for the conservative CDU/CSU, the 'Union', to pick up the pieces and sweep the election. Helmut Kohl's personal protegé, Angela Merkel, will be the main beneficiary. She will be the eighth Federal Chancellor of the FRG and the first woman to fill that post."
 GER_energy_reform: "Energy Reform"
 GER_energy_reform_desc: "The conservative Union opposed the Red-Green 'Atomkonsens' of 2000, in which the government decided to gradually shift away from nuclear energy in favor of renewables. The Merkel team views this step as rushed and vows to use nuclear energy for a longer period of time - and it would take a natural disaster close to a vulnerable nuclear power plant to make them flip flop on that promise..."
 GER_gesundheitspraemie: "Gesundheitsprämie"
 GER_gesundheitspraemie_desc: "A constantly popular talking point for conservative movements is the bloated nature of the budget. The Union, keenly aware of the German people's satisfaction with the healthcare program, attempted to reform its government budgeting by introducing a new kind of health tax, the 'Gesundheitsprämie'. It seeks to decrease the costs of employers and reshift them to the people in need of the service."
 GER_bmvi: "BMVI"

 GER_digitalrat: "Digitalrat"
 GER_digitalrat_desc: "Called upon by the Merkel IV cabinet, a digital council was established in 2018. Consisting of forward-thinking giants and innovative start up CEOs of multimedia and innovation, the chancellor's new digital advisor elite will provide her with more effective and profitable plans for Germany's digitalization efforts."
 GER_seek_centrist_compromises: "Seek Centrist Compromises"
 GER_seek_centrist_compromises_desc: "In order to secure power after Angela Merkel's election, the CDU should seek to establish a \"Grand Coalition\" between the Union and the SPD, the two largest parties. This would double up to assure limited conservative policy making and to isolate Gerhard Schröder. Schröder had humiliated himself after the election defeat and Angela Merkel would be able to assume the chancellorship with a clean sheet."
 GER_token_atomausstieg: "Token Atomausstieg"
 GER_token_atomausstieg_desc: "The 2005 Campaign had seen a pro-nuclear CDU/CSU pitted against the anti-nuclear SPD. The energy question will have to be solved to an unsatisfactory end for both sides in the coalition negotiations: The CDU/CSU will agree to an exit out of nuclear energy (German: \"Atomausstieg\") in the distant future, but the SPD will agree to not seek to accelerate the process beyond the Union's wishes."
 GER_strengthen_the_service_sector: "Strengthen the Service Sector"
 GER_strengthen_the_service_sector_desc: "West Germany completed its transformation into a service economy in the aftermath of the 1950s economic miracle and the downturn of the coal and heavy industry of the Ruhr. Since then, the country is a familiar face to young innovators, with Berlin standing as one of the world capitals of Start Up businesses."
 GER_industrial_outsourcing: "Industrial Outsourcing"
 GER_industrial_outsourcing_desc: "The German industrial sector has been massively weakened by the growth of wages and the free movement of labor to less fortunate European markets like Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. The German government needs to make sure that the movement of industrial concerns is controlled by government subsidies and EU incentives in order to not lose jobs to more hostile rivals like China."
 GER_redistribute_cap_subsidies: "Redistribute CAP Subsidies"
 GER_redistribute_cap_subsidies_desc: "Launched in 1962, the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) distributes farming subsidies to the union's various agricultural sectors. Germany, a service economy, has a workforce share of only about 2% in the primary sector. Currently, the CAP funds are too stacked towards the 'first pillar', the farmers that are already wealthy. Redistribution of these funds could provide relief to small farmers."
 GER_european_business_opportunities: "European Business Opportunities"
 GER_european_business_opportunities_desc: "With the removal of trade barriers across the continent, everyone's economic profit grows - but Germany's most of all, and that's good. We must work further to remove tariffs and trade restrictions, and make it easier to open businesses and make trade."
 GER_global_trade_initiatives: "Global Trade Initiatives"
 GER_global_trade_initiatives_desc: "Germany openly refers to itself as \"Exportweltmeister\", 'world champion of exports'. German goods are shipped into the entire world: Britain loves Germany's gummy bears, Chinese businessmen drive BMW and American companies use German machine parts. Our shippings will reach every port in the world."
 GER_animal_rights_reform: "Animal Rights Reform"
 GER_animal_rights_reform_desc: "The people at large are taking notice of brutalities against animals - more than 99% male chickens are slaughtered upon births, for example, as only female chickens are useful to lay eggs for agricultural production. Such atrocities are good for business, but are really unpopular with public. Some organizations like Greenpeace or PETA and populations like vegetarians and vegans are particularly annoyed."
 GER_radicalize_german_conservatism: "Radicalize German Conservatism"
 GER_radicalize_german_conservatism_desc: "Merkel should refuse any coalition and lead a minority government against leftist opposition. The Union could do so with limited initial aid from the FDP, even though further assistance from right wing members among the Greens and the SPD would be required to actually get policy made. A politically somewhat unsuccessful term, it might be ideologically useful to position the Union as conservative hardliners."
 GER_military_spending_offensive: "Military Spending Offensive"
 GER_military_spending_offensive_desc: "Schröder's SPD was always very happy to cut defense spending, reasoning that the Cold War was over and that the money was more needed in the social safety net and the welfare state. The CDU/CSU was left concerned about reaching the 2%-goal provided by NATO to its member states, demanding that 2% of GDP should be in defense spending. Germany needs to hurry to meet that demand."
 GER_partial_autobahn_privatization: "Partial Autobahn Privatization"
 GER_partial_autobahn_privatization_desc: "The privatization of the German highway system, the 'Autobahn', remains a hot-button issue in German politics. Leftist parties are generally supportive of big-government solutions and the total government control of the German road system, whereas the Free Democrats and Christian Democrats are more friendly to the idea of allowing private businesses into the equation."

 GER_rehabilitate_prussia: "Rehabilitate Prussia"
 GER_rehabilitate_prussia_desc: "During German occupation, Law No. 46 by the Allied authorities saw to the dissolution of the Free State of Prussia on 25 February 1947. Prussia played a huge part in German history and its cultural association with German monarchism and militarism mark it as a nationalist relic of times gone by - a fervor that the government could play into by certain nostalgic acts rehabilitating the Prussian state."
 GER_imperial_ambition: "Imperial Ambition"
 GER_imperial_ambition_desc: "While often blamed for the initial rise of German proto-fascist sentiment and often associated with the blind nationalistic fervor of the early 1910s, the German Empire of 1871 to 1918 marked an era of stability and prosperity that the rest of Europe at that time failed to replicate."
 GER_reestablish_local_thrones: "Reestablish Local Thrones"
 GER_reestablish_local_thrones_desc: "While the German people at large remain skeptical of the return of the monarchy, some individual states are not as reserved: Returning the royal families of Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg and Hannover to their social positions, albeit as figureheads, should make the idea more likable to the more republican-minded parts of the German people. Let the boulevard press write about our own monarchs for once."
 GER_hohenzollern_restoration: "Hohenzollern Restoration"
 GER_hohenzollern_restoration_desc: "All preparations for constitutional changes are complete - the Federal Republic can be laid to rest, and a new constitutional monarchy can take its place. The Hohenzollern dynasty has made clear again and again that they do not seek power, but we should be able to convince them to ceremonially lead a loving people. In the background, we can then run the show with fewer obstacles."
 GER_national_ambition: "National Ambition"
 GER_national_ambition_desc: "Germany has one of the on a global cultural scale most infamous nationalisms of any country's history. The brutal atrocities committed under the influence of said nationalism has led to reservations against German nationalism both within the German cultural mindset and in the historic memory of any foreigner affected - countries like Poland or Russia would disapprove of nationalist resurgence."
 GER_voelkisch_fervor: "Völkisch Fervor"
 GER_voelkisch_fervor_desc: "To reestablish a feeling of national superiority is to reaffirm a culture of bigotry and resentful stereotypes that built up and survived in a German culture in spite of its heavy cultural aversions to any form of nationalism and bigotry. The Italians are sleazy, the Polish are thieves, the Russians smell, the Arabs are rapists, the Jews want our money. Deutsche, wehrt euch!"
 GER_dismantle_democracy: "Dismantle Democracy"
 GER_dismantle_democracy_desc: "The ongoing national revolution has failed to catch the hearts of minds of many of Germany's population. Foreigners, intellectuals and the pro-European middle class have united in a socio-political block against our national resurgence. Much to their detriment however, the national revolution can count on high-ranking military members. The leftist filth wants to vote us out next election? What election is that?"
 GER_cfsp_studies: "CFSP Studies"
 GER_cfsp_studies_desc: "After numerous EU failures in the Balkans during the late Balkans, most notably the non-intervention of Dutch peacekeeping units at Srebrenica in 1995, the European Union must be vigilant in the creation of its new Common Foreign Security Policy, the CFSP."

 # Bundeswehr Reform
 GER_bundeswehr_reform: "Bundeswehr Reform"
 GER_bundeswehr_reform_desc: "Since the end of the Second World War, Germany's military has been severely restricted in size and scope. With the German government spending less on the military than other European powers such as France and the United Kingdom, Germany's forces face chronic supply problems and dysfunctional weapons systems. After soldiers used broomsticks rather than machine guns in a recent training exersize, the time has more than come to reform the Bundeswehr and ensure that Germany can properly defend itself."

 GER_modernized_auftragstaktik_desc: "Auftragstaktik (officially known as 'Führen mit Auftrag' or 'leading by mission') is a military tactic where the outcome of a mission is proritized over how that outcome is accomplished. Known as mission command in the United States and United Kingdom, the tactic gives greater flexibility to individual unit commanders and is compatable with modern net-centric concepts and command and control (C2)."
 GER_small_arms_grants: "A New Standard Rifle"
 GER_small_arms_grants_desc: "The German G36 rifle, made standard by the Bundeswehr in 1996 has since been found to overheat and lose accuracy in hot weather.

 GER_modern_armored_assaults: "Modern Armored Assaults"

 GER_young_officer_class_desc: "To meet the ever-increasing demand of the German armed forces in their peacekeeping and NATO deployments across the globe, a new generation of young men and women must heed the call and serve their country to the best of their ability.

 GER_vehicle_development_grants: "Vehicle Development Grants"
 GER_vehicle_development_grants_desc: "The majority of the Bundeswehr uses aging vehicles from the Cold War, many of which through years of neglect and a lack of maintainence have fallen into disrepair.

 GER_infantry_tactics_reform_desc: "When the First World War began, prevailing infantry combat tactics were drastically transformed.

 GER_fiscal_responsibility: "Fiscal Responsibility"
 GER_fiscal_responsibility_desc: "The 2% defense spending goal pushed upon us by our NATO allies should be upheld, however any more than is required is a waste of resources. We must be responsible and ensure that the welfare of our people is as important as the welfare of our armed forces. With a sizeable defense force and our greater ability to help our allies in foreign peacekeeping operations, Germany is both safer and richer."
 GER_influence_in_turkey: "Influence in Turkey"
 GER_influence_in_turkey_desc: "Turkish nationals make up much of Germany's immigrant population. It is only natural that we should embrace the meeting of our cultures and secure greater trade and cultural bonds between our people."

 GER_military_conservatism_desc: "The military is an essential part of the German nation. While moderates contend that the welfare of the people is as important as the military, they like to forget that without a strong, well-funded military, the people are vulnerable to external threats.

But this fact got overshadowed by our intervention in the Kosovo war which also marked Germanys first involvement in an active war since the second world war. Also the donation affair from the CDU was in the news and the fear about a possible blackout because of the new millenium.\n\nBut today will not be just known for the biggest party night in Germany.

 germany.5.d: "For the first time since the second world war, Germany participate in a war again. The NATO led operation called 'Allied Forces' has the goal to stop Serbian war crimes against minorities living in the region, like Croats or Bosnians. The German intervention is limited to some Tornados (Multi-role aircraft) which have the task to bomb Serbian military targets to stop there operations completely.\n\nWhile this binds us closer to our allies in the NATO and the EU, internally this divides German politicians. Whilk the opposition mostly supported our participation, our coalition partner and also the SPD are known to be mostly pacifistic. The current situation breaks this policy completely and led to many internal discussion among many high ranking politicians."

B90/Grüne voted united against any involvement in Afghanistan and even go as far as saying that the current coalition is an empty shell and not worth it to continue. Former B90/Grünen head Joschka Fischer told the press afterwards that it was a big mistake to enter the government together with the SPD and apologized for this mistake in front of his party members."

As a continuation with B90/Grünen became impossible and CDU/CSU already told the press to decline any offer to join a coalition with the SPD as a minor partner.\n\nWith no other options left to form a coalition, Schröder starts to think about early elections, to either gain a new majority or let someone else take over the seat.\n\nAnother option would be to form a minority government, but again the opposition would simply decline any law till the parliament got reelected.\n\nThe last option would be to declare an 'Gesetzgebungsnotstand'.

They changed our society in the past years, but we think too less about what this means for the society in our country. We need to confront these questions in the future. We need to discuss them in the public, above all parties and societies. And we need to act - without fear or dreaming. To be succesfull we need to tackle the two main obstackles: fear which often leads to hatred and brutality and dreaming about a false friendliness to foreigners which pretends everything is fine when people from different cultures come together.\n\nLets face one fact: people of different cultures and origin immigrate to our country and this wont change anytime soon. Our combined main goal should thus be the integration of these people. Without the workers from many different countries, our economy would get in big trouble pretty soon. They also pay taxes and help to finance our retirement system. As different as they all are, they have one thing in common: they all look for a refugee or home in Germany, if its voluntarely or forced, some temporarely, some forever. Each of them has his own biography, his own dreams, his own cultural and religious stance and his own personal way to deal with others.\n\nWe need a new, united, effort to shape the society in our country. Let us define our interests and goals, let us decide how we want to shape integration, let us set realistic goals. Education is the most important requirement for a sucessfull integration, it needs to be an integral part of our educational policy. Europe needs an united immigration policy, but each country also has its own burden. I encourage you, take part in the society. In the school, in the cities, in sport clubs. I also encourage you to learn german! If we want to speak together, we need to understand each other.

Ludger Volmer was quite surprised when he read the headlines from the big German newspapers, that they named it after him, as he was at the time the decree got worked out stationed in a hospital for a needed treatment.\n\nThe decree encourages the employees in the embassies to accept visa applications, even if its not absolutely sure if the applicant really wants to return home after the visa expired.\n\nThe public mostly welcomed the decree with open arms, all ahead german companies, human rights organizations and politicians.\n\nOtto Schily, our minister of the interior, and some former high ranking politicians of the FDP spoke against it.

More interesting is however, that leading industrial figures and politicians came up with the idea to accept this and other similiar travel insurances as a proof of creditworthiness which is needed to apply for a visa.\n\nThis coupled with our introduced Volmer decree could help us attract even more people to come to Germany on a short term.\n\nAlthought we noticed a slight increase in illegal activities which are directly connected to the Volmer decree, we still have the public support to introduce this method."

The applier can go to a registered travel agency where the agency takes over the job to apply for the visa.\n\nA travel agency in Neu-Ulm (and probably many others too) took advantage of this situation and sold made up travel trips to Germany. He collected the applications and sended them afterwards to the German embassy in Kiev. After the persons then entered Germany with a legal short-term visa, they simply dissapeared, traveled further to other European countries or started to work in dubious areas.\n\nWe hoped to fight illegal activities in front of our embassies, but it seems we just moved the problem to another region. The opposition parties now demand to scrap the Reisebüroverfahren."

 germany.20.b: "The positive effects are more important"
 germany.21.t: "Problems With The Volmer Decree"
 germany.21.d: "Our embassies report a massive increase over the last couple of months for applications of short-term visas, especially in easter Europe. It became normal to buy an travel insurance for as much as $1000, move into Germany and basically disappear afterwards. Experts already suggest that the only way to fix this problem is to revert it to statues quo as it originally was. The Volmer Erlass made life easier for some, but also encouraged illigal immigration, human trafficing and forced prostitution in a large style.\n\nAs that isnt already enough, the EU announced to look into this topic as its suspects the German government to break the Schengen Agreement and European law with this decree."
 germany.21.a: "It was wrong to introduce it in the first place"
 germany.21.b: "Now we keep it"
 germany.22.t: "EU Sues Germany Over The Volmer Erlass - Germany Loses"
 germany.22.d: "Germanies decision to keep the Volmer decree into action led to the decision by the EU to sue Germany over it. The European Union accused Germany to break our Schengen Agreement and European law in general.\n\nThe battle before the court lasted some months now but in the end, the European Court of Justice ruled that Germanies introduction of the decree broke existing law and thus forced us to take back the decree immediately."

 germany.25.d: "The 'Ecotax' was a project from the green party B90/Grüne and meet many resistances, even from its coalition partner the CDU. As soon as it was introduced, the courts were flooded with constitutional lawsuits from the Association of Taxpayers, Associations of freight forwarders and the Association of cold stores. In a public action, the liberal party FDP paid the tax costs of all fuels at a fuel station in Berlin. 300 people could refuel this way for extremely cheap prices."
 germany.25.a: "Just because we increased the tax rate a little bit..."
 germany.26.t: "European Court Allows Women To Join The Bundeswehr"
 germany.26.d: "Our constitution from 1949 says explicitly that women are disallowed to serve in the German army. They were allowed to serve as nurses or in the military music service, but don't hold a weapon. As a consequence of that, 1996 a german woman sued the government as her application to join the army as a normal soldier got denied. The case got before the European Court and it has decided now that its against the law of the EU.\n\nThe German parliament needs to rewrite that paragraph of the constitution in the near future, but soon women can apply to join the army as equal soldiers."
 germany.26.a: "More hands to hold a weapon"
 germany.27.t: "Egon Krenz Injailed"
 germany.27.d: "The last leader of the German Democratic Republic and its ruling party SED, Egon Krenz, faces 6 1/2 years of prison time in Berlin-Hakenfelde. Krenz was in charge for just 49 days, but even in this last days people died from the force of the border guards. For these murders he got the sentence already in 1997, but thanks to his complaints and revisions before other courts he came free again after 18 days. This time, however, it seems he will remain long in the prison. Krenz still denies the accusations and says he's a victim of the winners justice now. Also, he denies any responsibility of West German courts for GDR citizens, but that won't help him now visiting his old comrades in prison."
 germany.27.a: "Goodbye Krenz"
 germany.28.t: "Vodafone Merges With Mannesmann AG"
 germany.28.d: "The Mannesmann AG is Germanies biggest cellular provider and started the privatisation of the German telecommunication market as D2. 1999 it bought one of its biggest concurrent in Europe, the British Orange company. As a reaction, the also British Vodafone GmbH announced to show interest in buying the Mannesmann AG for themselves, where it already holds around 30% of its share portion.\n\nVodafone offered in the original proposal 100 Billion Euro, later expanded that sum to 190 Billion. The Board of Directors of the Mannesmann already agreed to that proposal and soon Germanies biggest and one of its fastest-growing company will be split up and sold.\n\nThis process would be the first foreign takeover of an important German business and also the biggest in the world's history. Since back when the Mannesmann AG started its telecommunication business, another company called Telekom also joined the business area as a result of the German Post privatisation and grows quickly. If we want to stop this from happening, our last option would be to open an antitrust proceeding and stop the takeover from happening."
 germany.28.a: "Let them merge, we have the Telekom"
 germany.28.b: "We won't allow that"
 germany.29.t: "German Bahn Cancells Transrapid Route Between Hamburg And Berlin"
 germany.29.d: "The planned Transrapid route between Hamburg and Berlin would be Germanies and Europes first Transrapid route at all. 1994 the planning started for the 430km/h fast magnetic levitation train and in recent years a test route in Emsland was build. Financed was the project by a consortium of Thyssen, Siemens, Daimler-Benz and AEG.\n\nBesides the enormous sum of 5 Billion Euro to build it, activists protests against it because of noise pollution and possible environmental problems. Over the years the numbers of income for the route sunk together with its assumed passengers and thus the consortium decided to stop the project altogether, as the costs grew exponential, even with an almost finished planning."
 germany.29.a: "We have better ways to spend our money"
 germany.29.b: "We pay for the route, but not the maintance"

Luckily just 9 people died and 149 people were injured, but the search and rescue operation lasted till the next day. Over 850 rescue workers we're bound in the area for many days afterwards. Currently, the reason for this tragic accident is unknown, but a thorough investigation will tell us soon more.\n\nWhat makes this event even more tragic is that just 1 and a half year before the even worse train accident of Eschede happened, with 110 dead."

 germany.31.d: "German President Johannes Rau visited Jerusalem as the first German head of State and spoke in front of its parliament, the Knesset. He apologized for the monstrous things Germany did during WW2 to jews and warns following generation to don't forget them.\n\nIn Israel however the speech was met with mixed feelings. The biggest critique was that he spoke German in front of the parliament. 'It's not just the language from Heine, Freud and Einstein, also from Hitler and Himmler' said the President of the Knesset.\n\nIn The next days he also wants to visit Palestina to promote a peace treaty between both sides and speak with the Palestinian President."
 germany.31.a: "For a long lasting friendship"

His opening speech included the proposal of the introduction of a German Green Card, to bring fresh IT experts into our country.\n\nBesides this speech, the congress was mostly build around the topic e-commerce and the new WAP protocoll. Besides all this big news about the internet, the new Windows 2000 was almost a sideline in this event."
 germany.32.a: "That Green Cards Sounds Like A Good Idea"
 ### CeBIT 2002 ### The CeBIT is Europes biggest telecommunication congress based in Hannover. This year the German chancellor Gerhard Schröder opened the congress together wuth his wife Doris Schröder.\n\nThis year it was allabout the new MMS function from [GER_mannesmann_yes_or_no] where you can send now messages like a SMS but with pictures instead. Another big topic is the build-up of UMTS as the next big step into the future for fast mobile internet connection. Again [GER_mannesmann_yes_or_no] seems to have a leap there as it announced in a big show the start of its new UMTS network in Germany.\n\nOn the sideline was the announcement of the new Microsoft Mira, a portable screen where you could work on it like at a PC.

 germany.33.d: "Fischer meet in Teheran the Iranian President Mohammed Chatami and its Foreign Minister Kamal Charrasi to talk about the relationship between Germany and the Iran. This is the first visit of a German Foreign Minister in Iran for 9 years now, as the last years were overshadowed by the Assassination of Kurds in the Greek Mykonos restaurant in Berlin and the fake trial againt Helmut Hofer. Now that Iran released Hofer, it made way for a new try to normalize the relations between both countries again.\n\nIn a joint press report by Fischer and Charrasi, both said that theres now a new chance for the German-Iranian relationship and announced that the Iranian President will visit Germany soon. The content of the talk were mostly about the situation of human rights in Iran, but also how both countries can normalize there relationship again."
 germany.33.a: "Maybee this time we can be friends"
 germany.34.t: "Helmut Hofer Comes Free"
 germany.34.d: "Hofer is a German businessman who sold car parts to various contacts in Iran. As he visited Teheran in 1997 for the third time, he got arrested for illicit sex with a medical student. He indeed meets her in a hotel foyer, gave her his business card and offered her a free stay in Hamburg if she wants to come there. He told the judges that they didn't even kiss, but the sentence was death by stoning in the end, as the media in Iran demanded it. German lawyers could later revert the sentence to imprisonment.\n\nA year later the court resumes the trial against Hofer, again for illicit sex with a Muslim, but now also for espionage and insulting Iranian officials. Again with the help from his lawyers and German officials the charges got dropped and his imprisonment lifted.\n\nBefore the Iranian government could summon him back to court for another trial, the German ambassador organized a flight back to Germany where he arrived today. It seems the 3 year-long hell trip ended for Helmut Hofer."
