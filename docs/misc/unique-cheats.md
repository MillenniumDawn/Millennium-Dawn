# Purpose of this Page

WIP: This is a living document. We will add things in here as they come up or as Bird remembers this exists.

This page is a list of all of the documented cheats from Millennium Dawn. We do also provide a basic cheat decision category. This is merely to help those who are looking for some more granular Millennium Dawn debug commands.

[Vanilla Console Commands](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Console_commands)

## How to Enable Cheat Decisions

There is two ways to enable cheat decisions. The first is via the game rule. The second is via running this command in this console:
``set_global_flag game_rule_allow_cheat_decisions``

## Political Cheats

This section handles all of our political cheats/debugging effects.

Outlook Keys:

- nationalist (Nationalist Outlook)
- fascism (Salafist Outlook)
- communism (Emerging Outlook)
- democratic (Western Outlook)
- neutrality (Non-Aligned Outlook)

The vanilla command ``add_party_popularity`` does work with Millennium Dawn. The subideology party section does not immediately update. You can just wait a day or open the subideology screen to see the update.

## Economic System Cheats

This section handles all of our economic system cheats/debugging effects.

### Economic Variables

``set_var treasury 10000`` - Sets the countries current treasury to 10000

``set_var debt 0`` - Sets the countries current debt to 0

``set_var int_investments 10000`` - Sets the countries international investments to 10000
