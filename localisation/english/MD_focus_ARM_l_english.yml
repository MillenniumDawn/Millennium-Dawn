ARM_army: "The Army in A New Era"
ARM_army_desc: "After the end of the Artsakh War, the Armenian army, which had shown itself, experienced a significant decline, which began even after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Thanks to the Soviet legacy, as well as a large-scale militia, the Armenians managed to defeat Azerbaijan and establish a precarious balance in the region. Old doctrines, as well as outdated weapons, ossified generals and economic problems put an end to the development of the armed forces. The main way of development is the continuation of cooperation with Russia, as well as with other neighbors and partners in the CSTO. However, some military experts insist on a complete overhaul of the military doctrine and structure of the army along the Western lines. Armenia, being in a diplomatically advantageous position, can try to take the best from each side, or take a clear course of cooperation with certain forces. Even without significant resources, Armenia has great potential if it can correctly distribute its priorities."

##Negotiations

karabakh.10.d: "In the nineties, Azerbaijan, recognizing our victory, agreed to recognize Artsakh if we agreed to give Azerbaijan the Hadrut region in exchange for recognition. Surrendering lands in exchange for recognition may be a good deal, but our internal forces may be very unhappy with it. This deal may also destroy our ability to have some political ambitions..."
karabakh.10.a: "We must agree. It is more future-oriented solution."

karabakh_news.2.o1: "Peace in Caucasus?"

karabakh.12.t: "[ARM.GetNamewithFlag] Demands Full NKR Recognition!"
karabakh.12.d: "In its recent statement, the Armenian side denied our old conditions, under which the Hadrut region is transferred to us in exchange for our recognition of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. They demand full recognition of NKR without territorial changes. It is worth considering that at the moment Armenia significantly exceeds us in military power. For now."
karabakh.12.a: "We will win in the long term. Raise the stakes during next negotiations."
karabakh.12.b: "Maybe... accept their proposal?"

karabakh.15.t: "[AZE.GetNamewithFlag] Presents New Demands!"

karabakh.16.d: "Armenia rejected our negotiation terms and postponed the discussion about new terms to next meeting."
karabakh.16.a: "Let's prepare then."

karabakh.17.t: "New Negotiating Stance"
karabakh.17.d: "After the previous round of negotiations, which ended unsuccessfully, we should reconsider our demands on Armenia. Considering our strengthening on the world stage, we should also demand the Karvachar region in exchange for recognition of the NKR as part of Armenia.

karabakh.18.t: "[AZE.GetNamewithFlag]'s New Terms!"

karabakh.22.t: "[ARM.GetNamewithFlag]n Counteroffer!"
karabakh.22.d: "They are ready to give us 15$ if we will abandon NKR altogether. Should we agree?"

karabakh.25.t: "Opportunity in Nagorno-Karabakh!"
karabakh.25.d: "The war in Nagorno-Karabakh has been going on long enough to shake the balance of power in the region. Perhaps we should take advantage of this and introduce our peacekeepers into Artsakh, forcing Armenia to give up some territory. This will increase our influence on Armenia and Azerbaijan.
