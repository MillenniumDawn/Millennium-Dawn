 # EVENTS
 AGRI.1.t: "Potential Drought Incoming..."
 AGRI.1.d: "Our top scientists and experts at the Agriculture Ministry are concerned about the possibility of a drought arising somewhat shortly, no rain seems to be forecast either... hopefully we have prepared for all possibilities."
 AGRI.1.A: "Fingers crossed..."

 AGRI.2.t0: "The Scientists Were Wrong!"
 AGRI.2.d0: "Thankfully in this instance the scientists and experts were wrong, we avoided a drought this time, but next time we might not be so lucky..."
 AGRI.2.A: "We should prepare for a bad harvest"
 AGRI.2.B: "A bad harvest? What about a terrible one?"
 AGRI.2.C: "No need! We were fine this time and we will be the next too!"

 AGRI.2.t1: "The Scientists Were Right! Sort Of"
 AGRI.2.d1: "The scientists and experts were only partially correct, whilst a drought has occurred, it seems to be localised to only one or two regions in [ROOT.GetName]. This shouldn't be too severe to deal with, although it may spread to any neighbouring regions should we not resolve the problem."
 AGRI.2.D: "This doesn't seem so bad, let it run its course."
 AGRI.2.E: "We can spare some money to help resolve the situation."
 AGRI.2.F: "This needs immediate action!"
 AGRI.2.G: "This might be overkill, but we'd rather be safe."

 AGRI.2.t2: "The Scientists Were Right!"
 AGRI.2.d2: "The drought struck at its worst today, with dozens dead already and many more expected to succumb to the disaster in the upcoming weeks ahead, we need to take immediate action so this dire situation cannot get much worse"
 AGRI.2.H: "We don't have much of a choice but to let it run its course."
 AGRI.2.I: "This won't solve everything, but it's better than nothing."
 AGRI.2.J: "Hopefully this will tide us over until the next rains."
 AGRI.2.K: "Thank heavens for this stockpile, use as much as needed!"

 AGRI.2.t3: "A Catastrophic Drought!"
 AGRI.2.d3: "This is an absolute disaster... hundreds lay dead due to the massive droughts that are now seemingly widespread in [ROOT.GetName], with the expectation that this will likely spread to neighbouring nations, we need to take a hold of the situation, if we can..."
 AGRI.2.L: "We can't stop it, God forgive us..."
 AGRI.2.M: "If only we had more to stop this disaster!"
 AGRI.2.N: "This is not nearly enough, but it should help with the worst of it."
 AGRI.2.O: "Our stockpile is bountiful, and this will be enough, although costly..."

 # NEIGHBOUR EVENTS
 AGRI_neighbour.1.t: "Localised Drought is Affecting [FROM.GetName]!"
 AGRI_neighbour.1.d: "One of our neighbours, [FROM.GetName], is experiencing a drought, thankfully it seems to be somewhat localised, and would require very little help to stop it in its tracks, we could however send some aid in order to gain favour with our neighbour."

 AGRI_neighbour.100.d: "[FROM.GetName] is showing us that in a pinch, they can't be relied on, whilst this drought is one that we can surely deal with on our own, it would've been nice to have some help."

 AGRI_neighbour.2.t: "Large Scale Drought is Affecting [FROM.GetName]!"
 AGRI_neighbour.2.d: "One of our neighbours, [FROM.GetName], is experiencing a drought, originally the experts predicted it to remain localised, but they were wrong. It looks as though things may be worse than anticipated, [FROM.GetName] would benefit greatly from our aid and may even open their doors to us in future."
 AGRI_neighbour.2.A: "Provide aid to [FROM.GetName]"
 AGRI_neighbour.2.B: "We can profit from this!"

 AGRI_neighbour.200.A: "Bastards."

 AGRI_neighbour.3.t: "Massive Scale Drought is Affecting [FROM.GetName]!"
 AGRI_neighbour.3.d: "One of our neighbours, [FROM.GetName], is experiencing a drought, the experts once believed this to be an easy to deal with thing, but they were wrong. The land in [FROM.GetName] looks as though it may remain completely dry and barren for the foreseeable future, if we are to help our neighbour, it needs to be immediate and substantial, we cannot afford nature to win this time."
 AGRI_neighbour.3.A: "Provide aid to [FROM.GetName]"
 AGRI_neighbour.3.B: "We can profit from this!"
 AGRI_neighbour.3.C: "How are our stockpiles looking?"
 AGRI_neighbour.3.D: "We're not home right now!"

 AGRI_neighbour.30.t: "Our Neighbour [FROM.GetName] Sends Us Some Aid!"
 AGRI_neighbour.30.d: "[FROM.GetName] seems to know what being a good neighbour is all about, and has sent us a substantial amount of aid in order to stem the tides of the drought."
 AGRI_neighbour.30.A: "Thank the heavens!"

 AGRI_neighbour.300.t: "Our Neighbour [FROM.GetName] Refuses To Send Aid!"
 AGRI_neighbour.300.d: "[FROM.GetName] is showing us that in a pinch, they can't be relied on, God, and [FROM.GetName] have abandoned us."
 AGRI_neighbour.300.A: "Where are the [FROM.GetAdj] flags? They need to be burned!"

 AGRI_random.1.A: "Shady characters? They're just businessmen!"

 AGRI_random.10.t1: "Just Don't Ask Where It Came From"
 AGRI_random.10.d1: "The Farmers aren't happy with the equipment we sourced, they say our explanation of the equipment falling off the back of a truck isn't good enough. As long as they're not as unhappy as they would've been had we not sourced them in the first place it's a success to us."
 AGRI_random.10.A: "Let's not make a habit of it..."

 AGRI_random.10.t2: "Shootouts With The Smugglers!"
 AGRI_random.10.d2: "We'll have our Agriculture Minister's head for this! Trying to make deals with the smugglers resulted in them not only taking the money, but also trying to hold onto the equipment, so many of our soldiers gunned down in cold blood, this is unacceptable!"
 AGRI_random.10.B: "Those bastards"

 AGRI_random.10.t3: "They Took The Money And Ran..."
 AGRI_random.10.d3: "Well, our Agriculture Minister's pay is docked for the next decade or so, the fool set up a deal with smugglers who told the trading party to wait around for the equipment, well... you can guess what happened. 16 hours they waited for the smugglers to return, terrible stuff."
 AGRI_random.10.C: "Balls."

 AGRI_random.100.t1: "They're Not Pretty, But They Work"
 AGRI_random.100.d1: "The Farmers are pretty pleased with what we managed to source, it might not be the prettiest or newest kit, but it works, and that's just about all we could ask for given our current situation."
 AGRI_random.100.A: "We averted disaster here"

 AGRI_random.100.t2: "Another Embargo?!"
 AGRI_random.100.d2: "Whoever we have running the negotiations in the Trade Ministry should be shot. We have no idea how they messed up this badly but we have another embargo sent our way, unbelievable. Not only that, but the Farmers are furious with us!"
 AGRI_random.100.B: "Oh bollocks..."

 AGRI_random.100.t3: "Hardly Anything Works"
 AGRI_random.100.d3: "\"Like New\" my arse! Nearly all the equipment we managed to source is completely broken, seized up or just simply won't show signs of life, the Farmers are pretty pissed at us..."
 AGRI_random.100.C: "Did we keep the receipt?"

 AGRI_random.2.t: "The Fields Are Looking Pretty Dry..."
 AGRI_random.2.d: "During this time of year, our fields are usually far more forgiving than what they are, our Agriculture Minister is concerned that this could be leading up to a more serious drought rather than just \"a bit too much sun\".\n\nIf money is tight we could always try and siphon off some of our neighbours' water supplies..."
 AGRI_random.2.A: "Ehh, we should solve this ourselves..."

 AGRI_random.20.t3: "Nothing Has Changed!"
 AGRI_random.20.d1: "It seems as though the swift action of the government has solved the potential drought issue, with no enemies made and even a potential increase in expected harvest prices."
 AGRI_random.20.d2: "Whilst it seems as though we have managed to stem the tide of the dry land, some peripheral lands are still looking a little parched and we may see a lesser harvest from that particular crop type. No matter, the majority of the crops have been saved."
 AGRI_random.20.d3: "Despite our best efforts, it seems as though the fields just will not take and seem drier than ever, this may end up turning into a full scale drought, we must be ready for the worst."
 AGRI_random.20.A: "Glad to hear it!"
 AGRI_random.20.B: "I hope it was only the vegetables."
 AGRI_random.20.C: "Hold on to your butts!"

 AGRI_random.200.d1: "With some money in the right places, we managed to steal some of our neighbour's water without their knowledge, hopefully the people we paid off remain quiet. Our own problems have been solved, for now."
 AGRI_random.200.d2: "Having paid off who we thought were the right people, our acquisitions team were locked and loaded with the water lines but were unfortunately busted by [FROM.GetAdj] authorities. They seem to be quite upset with our government's actions."
