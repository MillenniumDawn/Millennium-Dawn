 ISR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "以色列曾是《以赛亚书》预言人类将“将刀铸成犁头，将枪铸成镰刀”的土地，但自从犹太人民两千年来首次重新获得独立以来，以色列国经历了太多的血腥屠杀。1995年11月，拉宾总理遇刺身亡，1990年代奥斯陆协议进程的乐观情绪也随之消亡，尽管巴拉克总理乐观，但第二次起义不可避免。但以色列会从中崛起吗？是昔日的空壳，还是能够按照自己的条件进行谈判的崛起地区大国？它将如何处理迄今为止一直被彻底回避的犹太和民主之间的微妙平衡？"

 israel_news.1.d: "More than seventeen tons of bombs have been detonated over a military site known as the 'Bustan' southeast of Dier Ezzor in Northeastern Syria late this night, right next to the Euphrates. While many options have been raised to indicate the potential perpetrator of the strike, Western analysts have pointed at Israel as the most likely actor to conduct such a strike due to intelligence reports suggesting it is, in fact, a reactor belonging to Syria's alledged secret nuclear program constructed with North Korean aid. It is unclear wether the reports have been true or not, and to what degree was the U.S. Administration informed of the strike, but as [SYR.GetLeader] swiftly moves to remove any evidence pointing at a nuclear program, one thing is clear - twenty-six years after it destroyed Iraq's first nuclear program, the Begin Doctrine is still maintained by Israeli policymakers."

Today, it had finally happened. After [SAU.GetLeader] gave his blessing for a treaty in exchange for American military guarantees and Israeli concessions on the Palestinian issue, [USA.GetLeader] had invited the Saudi Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister to sign an official peace treaty.

Israel, wether with military support or just knowledge of Washington, has assaulted the Islamic Republic with dozens of IAF planes, aimed at the country's nuclear targets. This shouldn't have suprised no one - as for decades now, Jerusalem had threatened military action to prevent Iran from ever reaching a nuclear weapon, in accordance to the Begin Doctrine and following similar actions against Syria and Iraq. But this strike wouldn't go unfollowed. Already, hundreds of thousands of Israel civilians have entered shelters and anti-air systems were put on high alert, prepared for the thousands of direct missiles which would inevitably come raining on Israeli cities."

Greece, long seen as the most hostile nations towards Israel in regards to the Palestinian Question, had aligned itself to Jerusalem to form a united front against Turkish demands in the sea, and to export Israeli and perhaps Egyptian gas towards the European Union.

In the wake of Iran's Second Revolution which ended with the overthrow of the Mullahs, this seems like a critical milestone in reestablishing the strong Iranian-Israeli strategic alliance from the times of Reza Shah, and in the spirit of Cyrus who released the Jews from captivity in Babylonia."

Today, this relationship has grown from bilateral ties to an official alliance, signed between [ISR.GetLeader] and many Arab ministers and statesmen in Tel Aviv. This alliance's goal is clear: Create a strategic and political architecture for the Middle East in an era where American power projection in the region is dwindling, to balance against shared rivals and end the bloodshed the region had seen for decades. Indeed - it can be seen as an American victory which easens its pivot to Asia to counter Beijing's influence in the Far East."

The foreign ministers agreed to make a meeting of the forum be a yearly event, each time in a different desertly area. Many observers pointed to this as the next step of the Abraham Accords, moving beyond simple normalization to full-on alliance between Israel and many of the moderate Sunni Arab Nations around it.

While in support of the Syrian regime, Iran had used the opportunity to put permanent presence of Hezbollah fighters - alongside other Shiite militias and headed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - in Syria, as a base from which to expand Iranian influence and the revolution and for the 'day of command' against Israel. However, Israeli policymakers according to foreign sources have informed their European and American counterparts that Jerusalem cannot stand idle and allow Syria to 'Become a Second Lebanon', and hence are preparing 'all options on the table.' Foreign sources point to a potential aerial campaign against Iranian militia targets all around the country, while avoiding regime targets to not be viewed as intervening in the civil war outright."

 israel_economy.162.t: "Israel wants to become AU observer state!"
 israel_economy.162.d: "Israeli relations with Sub-Saharan Africa flourished in the 195s and 196s. However, in the Yom Kippur War, Israeli forces crossed the canal and came into occupation of African soil. This resulted in most of the continent - essentially everyone except for Malawi and the Apartheid Regime in South Africa, including us - cutting off relations with the country. These relations were gradually restored in the 199s following the Oslo Accords, and many in the Israeli government see Africa as the continent from which Israel can improve its international image. Prime Minister [ISR.GetLeader] has recently launched a campaign to 'Return to Africa', using our salinization technologies and other innovative start-ups to improve the lives of the African people. As such, Jerusalem has approached us requesting to join the African Union as an observer state, similarly to the PLO. While many, especially in the EAC would support it, Algeria and especially South Africa declared strong opposition for the move."

 israel_economy.163.d: "Yesterday in the opening ceremony of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia has submitted to the Chairperson of the African Union Commission Israel's charter as an observer member to the African Union. In the 199's, Israel was an observer member of the Organization of African Unity, until it was dissolved and replaced by the African Union. However, it failed to rejoin due to pressure from South Africa and Algeria - two of the continent's largest nations. But not anymore. A political bloc, mainly led by Botswana, Ethiopia and members of the East African Community have managed to overpower the Arab-South African bloc and push this admission. This diplomatic achievement is the result of endless efforts by the Foreign Ministry, the African Division and Israeli embassies on the continent. This is a corrective step to the anomaly that has prevailed for almost two decades and is an important part of strengthening Israel's foreign relations fabric."
 israel_economy.163.a: "太棒了！"
 israel_economy.164.t: "Ethiopia vetoes our status!"
 israel_economy.164.d: "In a vote today in the African Union Commission regarding Israeli accession, our hopes were proven futile. Despite strong support from Botswana, Ethiopia, members of the East African community and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it was not enough to overpower the voices opposed to our accession to observer state status in the African Union. In the 199's, Israel was an observer member of the Organization of African Unity, until it was dissolved and replaced by the African Union. However, it failed to rejoin due to pressure from the Arab states as well as South Africa. Indeed, It is saddening to see the African Union taken hostage by a small number of extremist states like Algeria and South Africa, which are driven by hatred and controlled by Iranian and Qatari interests. Israel will continue to deepen its ties with Africa, no matter wether via the African Union or via backdoor channels and no matter how huminliating was it to watch our diplomats violently expelled from the chamber following the vote."

In fact, it is not a complete unification, at the moment the parties still have separate budgets and independent factions in the municipalities, but one way or another this union has a good chance in the elections and a bright future ahead."
