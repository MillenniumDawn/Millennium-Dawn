 donald_trump.0.t:0 "The Travel Ban"
 donald_trump.0.d:0 "With terrorism afoot around the globe, it is imperative we protect our citizens. We can protect Americans through enacting the Executive Order titled 'Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,' banning the residents of certain Muslim-majority countries with high prevalences of Muslim extremists. These countries, listed by the Obama administration, are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, and Somalia.\n\nHowever, getting this ban through without legal trouble may be difficult if we just include these countries, so expanding the ban to places like Venezuela, Chad, and North Korea would help dilute the list of countries and perhaps give us a better chance of having no legal trouble in the first place. It would take additional time to change, however. Do be aware that enacting this policy may have us face reciprocal policies from countries affected by our policy.\n\nWhat should we do?"
 donald_trump.0.o1:0 "Keep the ban limited"
 donald_trump.0.o2:0 "Expand the ban to other countries around the globe"
 
 donald_trump.1.t:0 "Travel Ban Challenged by Federal Courts"
 donald_trump.1.d1:0 "Today, just one day after the Travel Ban was set into effect, multiple courts sued our Administration over apparent breaches of the First Amendment, the Fith Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and various laws and a UN convention. This complaint is made despite the Constitution giving the President 'unreviewable authority' over immigration matters.\n\nWe have appealed this decision, but whatever the constitution says doesn't matter, it's what the court decides, and thus far, it seems stacked against us. Rewriting the Executive Order would perhaps allow us to better prepare against these lawsuits. Alternatively, we could just either try to push the current ban through or withdraw from a Travel Ban altogether. What shall we do, Mr. President?"
 donald_trump.1.d2:0 "Today, just one day after the Travel Ban was set into effect, multiple courts sued our Administration over apparent breaches of the Fith Amendment, the Tenth Amendment and various laws and a UN convention.

 donald_trump.1.o1:0 "Revise the ban"
 donald_trump.1.o2:0 "Push the ban through!"
 donald_trump.1.o3:0 "We can't afford to be entangled in legal battles"
 
 donald_trump.2.t:0 "Travel Ban Rejected in Federal Courts"
 donald_trump.2.d1:0 "The attempt to appeal to the courts over the Travel Ban has failed. The court adjudicated that our appeal has been dismissed. The Travel Ban, at this moment, has hardly any effect. We can remedy this decision by revising the ban. Conversely, we could bring it to the Supreme Court, though more Republican judges would make that process easier, or we can just drop the ban. Mr. President?"
 donald_trump.2.d2:0 "The attempt to appeal to the courts over our expanded Travel Ban has failed. The court adjudicated that our appeal has been dismissed. The Travel Ban, at this moment, has hardly any effect. We can remedy this decision by revising the ban. Conversely, we could bring it to the Supreme Court, though more Republican judges would make that process easier, or we can just drop the ban. Mr. President?"
 donald_trump.2.d3:0 "The attempt to appeal to the courts over our redone Travel Ban has failed. The court adjudicated that our appeal has been dismissed, just like the previous ban. Unfortunately, unlike the previous ban, we cannot really change the ban much without angering much of our base, so a move like that would be political suicide. That leaves our one option open being the Supreme Court, or we can just drop the ban and forget it. Mr. President, what shall we do?"
 donald_trump.2.o1:0 "Bring it to the Supreme Court!"
 donald_trump.2.o2:0 "Revise the ban"
 donald_trump.2.o3:0 "We can't afford to be entangled in legal battles"
 
 donald_trump.3.t:0 "Travel Ban Challenged by Federal Courts Again"
 donald_trump.3.d:0 "Our best hopes and wishes have not been fulfilled. After replacing the previous Travel Ban with a better, more resistant one, the courts have sued again. This time, however, the chances of an appeal going through is much higher, and so there is a serious chance that we could get the Travel Ban fully operational. Of course, even with the heightened chances, there is still a good probability that it fails. What shall we do?"
 donald_trump.3.o1:0 "Push the ban through!"
 donald_trump.3.o2:0 "We can't afford to be entangled in legal battles"
 
 donald_trump.4.t:0 "The Ban is Brought Before the Supreme Court"
 donald_trump.4.d:0 "All of our previous challenges have been at lower level courts. However, the Supreme Court is the highest court of the land, so their decision trumps all. Mr. President, surely you will win this time."
 donald_trump.4.o1:0 "Let the process begin"

 donald_trump.5.t:0 "The Court Votes Against the Ban"
 donald_trump.5.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, the best team of lawyers, the best tactics, the best campaigning, the Travel Ban has failed. Any further attempt to pass any travel ban is mute. This has been an unfortunate end."
 donald_trump.5.o1:0 "This was a waste of time"
 
 donald_trump.6.t:0 "The Court Votes Uphold Ban"
 donald_trump.6.d:0 "The persistent struggle for keeping the Travel Ban has paid off. The Supreme Court of the United States has upholded our Travel Ban. This is a great day, one of many to come."
 donald_trump.6.o1:0 "We finally have an end to this madness"

 donald_trump.7.t:0 "Travel Ban Succeeds"
 donald_trump.7.d1:0 "To our surprise, no-one has dared to challenge the Administration over the Travel Ban. This certainly is a surpise to us, but it's most definitely a welcome one."
 donald_trump.7.d2:0 "Despite the intentions of Democrats, the Travel Ban has succeeded. The days of court battles over the Travel Ban are over."
 donald_trump.7.d3:0 "Through being challenged, refused, revised, challenged again, and appealed, we can now finally see the Travel Ban be fully enacted with little fear of being sued again over it. The days of court battles over these Executive Orders are finally over."
 donald_trump.7.o1:0 "Huzzah!"
 
 #Asteroid Mining Event Chain
 donald_trump.8.t:0 "Launching the Asteroid Mining Initiative"
 donald_trump.8.d:0 "Asteroid Mining has been a fantasy for many before us. Asteroids themselves carry much wanted platinum group metals, gold, silver, and iron group metals. It could become extremely lucrative for any spacefaring country. So today, the establishment of an Asteroid Mining Initiative, or AMI, will provide the first step towards mining asteroids. Using vast telescope arrays across the United States, we can look for suitable asteroids in nearby outer space, then pull it into orbit and mine it. Spotting a suitable asteroid will be difficult, as, relative to the distance they are at, they are quite small. Luckily, there's actually quite a few which pass by Earth every so often, so it wouldn't take long to get one to stay in Earth's orbit."
 donald_trump.8.o1:0 "Just need to wait for an asteroid..."
 
 donald_trump.9.t:0 "Asteroid Spotted"
 donald_trump.9.d:0 "Recently, our scientists at NASA spotted a suitable asteroid passing near Earth. This has been a relief for the AMI, as some doubted if we'd actually ever spot a suitable, economical asteroid at all. However, this asteroid is moving slowly enough, is large enough, and is rich enough to be moved into orbit and mined. The asteroid is, in-fact, larger than the state of New York. The next step is simply to move this asteroid into orbit around Earth, which has never been done before. In the meantime, NASA engineers, and even private enterprises like SpaceX, have invented mechanisms to mine the asteroid, so they will be ready by the time the asteroid gets into orbit."
 donald_trump.9.o1:0 "Let's get that baby into orbit"
 
 donald_trump.10.t:0 "Asteroid in Orbit"
 donald_trump.10.d:0 "With the asteroid in orbit, NASA and SpaceX are both sending missions to the orbiting asteroid. NASA is mainly concerned about collecting scientific data, while SpaceX is more concerned about mining the material. No doubt this is a noteworthy achievement, which gives us an edge in space. There is even talk about bringing in more asteroids, but many say that additional asteroids can come later, as this asteroid is very large and well suited for mining. Other countries are already looking at us with envy, and are considering their own asteroid mining programs. The costs are extremely high even to develop the technology to even get there, so there is little worry among SpaceX or NASA that competition will arive."
 donald_trump.10.o1:0 "Mining shall begin"
 
 donald_trump.11.t:0 "Profits from Mining Start Pouring in"
 donald_trump.11.d:0 "After establishing mining operations, SpaceX and NASA have both sent back their first shipments of space-material to labs and markets around the globe. The world has jelously looked on us, and there have been open talks in their respective chambers of legislation about opening their own asteroid mining operations. While we soon may get competition, we can enjoy the monopoly for now."
 donald_trump.11.o1:0 "Huzzah!"
 
 donald_trump.12.t:0 "Profits from Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.12.d:0 "The latest shipments from our asteroid mining operations have come in, and have generated many revenues. These shipments include platinum, gold, and silver. Putting the revenues to good use would be wise."
 donald_trump.12.o1:0 "Excellent!"
 
 donald_trump.13.t:0 "Potential for Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.13.d:0 "Recently, Donald Trump has allowed NASA and SpaceX, a private space company, to bring a fairly large asteroid into orbit of Earth and mine it. Our advisors recommend we invest in this new space, as it could allow rare materials to be delivered straight to our country. Some, however, have cited the massive bill the United States had to pay to even start the operations, and oppose expanding into space. The return for this investment depends, but it may take 25 years to just break even. More substantial investment can bring this down, but we'll be far behind the United States for quite a while.\n\nWhat shall we do in regards to Asteroid Mining? Start a national program, or ignore it altogether?"
 donald_trump.13.o1:0 "Invest in Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.13.o2:0 "Too expensive and a waste of our time!"

 donald_trump.500.d:0 "For years, ISIS has been a terrorist threat not seen ever in history. Their influence is all over the globe, and while their in Iraq and Syria shrinks, their strangleholds in other areas continues. A determined bombing campaign would put an end to the terrorist threat. It would certainly be costly; however, it would lead to the eventual demise of ISIS. Another approach is to simply continue operations normally, still pounding ISIS troops, but with far less costs than the former option. A last option is to fully withdraw from the campaign against ISIS as it has almost been won already. While this would strengthen ISIS, it would allow us to divert resources to other areas. Mr. President, what shall we do?"

 donald_trump_news.0.t:0 "US Suspends War Against ISIS"
 donald_trump_news.0.d:0 "In a surprising White House press release, the Trump Administration has announced the withdrawal of US forces from the fight against ISIS. Donald Trump tweeted upon the matter, calling ISIS a \"dead terrorist group\" and that \"US troops will focus on other things.\" Supporters call this move necessary to limit unnecessary expenditure, while the opposition state that this will only make the terrorism situation worse. Experts believe this will embolden ISIS into taking an offensive stance against her neighbors, as she gathers more fighters in Iraq and Sytria. The Administration has made no comment to this critique so far."

In a press conference earlier today, WNN correspondant, Michael Miller, asked the President \"What are the current plans for American intevention against ISIS.\" Donald Trump replied to the statement by saying \"US bomber crews, of whom are very, very tough people, believe me. I mean, have you seen those people? They will fly over into Syria, and bomb the hell outta ISIS. Trust me, you will never have seen anything like it ever before.\" Experts warn this plan is expensive, but the President is adamant about his plans for ISIS.

This organization \"will seek to seek an asteroid, bring it into the orbit of Earth, mine it, and send its resources back to the USA.\" Many doubt if this could ever be profitable, as the immense costs will consume much of NASA's budget, however, the President has voiced his wishes for private space companies to do some of the work. One particular favorite, SpaceX, was pointed out directly in his speech on the AMI, stating \"Smart people, and boy, do we have some smart people, like my good friend at SpaceX, Elon Musk, will be able to send their space mining equipment to the asteroid, mine it, and sell it for profit. It will be a tremendous business, believe me.\" There are serious concerns for asteroid mining, however the Administration has been dismissive of those concerns, instead focusing on the rewards of the project. Whether this is successful or not will time will tell."

These materials of materials are not from any normal mine, but from asteroids.  A few months ago, NASA caught a large asteroid heading on a course which would place itself nearby earth. A relatively slow asteroid, it was pulled into an elliptical orbit with Earth. Mining operations started as soon as it was in orbit. This news has been a surpise to the world, as it has been done far faster than expected. Many countries are now seeking to start their own asteroid mining programs to counteract the American monopoly. The United States does claim the entire asteroid. However, this claim can only be sparsely enforced as the asteroid is so large. Asteroid mining will likely become a lucrative industry, with many successes and failures. Who will dominate the asteroid, nonetheless, remains a mystery."
