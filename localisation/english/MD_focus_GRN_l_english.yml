It is said that because everything has a spirit, it's considered just as grave offence to kill another lifeform without following proper rituals, as it is no different to killing a fellow human. The 'anirniit' is considered as an integral part of the surrounding ambience known as 'Sila', and many Inuit pay tribute and gain charactarisics of a certain spirit by taking its name or further more invoked by those who share a connection to the spirit."
