 PER_resistance_economy_desc: "The sanctions placed upon us have had, unfortunately, a substantial adverse effect on the our nuclear program by making it harder to acquire specialized materials and equipment needed for the program via imports. The economic effects of sanctions have also been especially severe on our oil-dominated economy, which both relies on imports in the form of technology, and on the export of crude oil.

 PER_resistance_economy_3: "Ban supply of hard currency for Luxury Good Imports"
 PER_resistance_economy_3_desc: "With our own currency reserves decreasing at a rapid rate, we have found it necessary to ban the use of Rials to purchase foreign luxury goods, even those that are widely sought by the public, such as cars and cellphones.

However, if we open our own factories dedicated to creating machine parts, then we will no longer have to rely on the West, and the few factories left can stay open."
 PER_resistance_economy_8: "Secure Strategic Goods"
 PER_resistance_economy_8_desc: "Our military has long required mass imports of weaponry, such as the Russian S-300 SAM, as our fledgeling military-complexes have not has the necessary resources to produce these on our own. However, due to the sanctions, we are not allowed to import weaponry, and our military is becoming underequiped as older models breakdown. This requires government intervention in the form of state owned military-complexes dedicated to the production of what we are lacking in, and we will need to make our own models of SAMs, rather than relying on imports and licenses."

In West Azarbaijan, it is also believed that there is a large deposit of yellowcake uranium.
