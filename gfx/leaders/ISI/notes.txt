Keeping up to tabs on current ISIS leaders isn't easy, not much info available after bombings and drone strikes started. Much of it's original military commanders are killed.

The commanders with pics here are still alive. Some other names popped up during my research, (mainly doing searching in arabic) but pics were not possible to find.

Update: Abu Omar al-Shishani is confirmed killed by ISIS. USA claims to have killed him several times, but he always shows up afterwards. Apparently not this time. He was the best skilled and most charismatic military leader they had. Keeping the image in case we need it for an earlier game start.
