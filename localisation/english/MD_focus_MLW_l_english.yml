 # UDF
 MLW_UDF.0.t: "The First President of Malawi"
 MLW_UDF.0.d: "Bakili Muluzi currently resides as not only the president of the UDF, but also the president of Malawi.\n\nThe United Democratic Front (UDF) is the first democratically elected party since the collapse of the one party state thanks to the §HReferendum of 1993§!. This puts the UDF in a unique position to kickstart the Malawian path to greatness, although there are criticisms from various parties regarding how much control the Muluzi family have over the party, and therefore the nation..."
 MLW_UDF.0.O1: "The UDF will lead Malawi to victory!"

 MLW_UDF.1.t: "What To Do With The Grain Reserves?"
 MLW_UDF.1.d: "The grain reserves of Malawi are filled to the brim, and many within the UDF are calling for this untapped wealth to be utilised properly, Muluzi has the final say but opposition parties are calling for these reserves to remain at all costs, lest we suffer a drought or famine."
 MLW_UDF.1.O1: "We have plenty to spare, don't be silly!"
 MLW_UDF.1.O2: "Well what if the rains aren't blessed?"

 MLW_UDF.10.t: "Wheeling and Dealing, Malawian Style"
 MLW_UDF.10.d: "A small fortune was made from the grain reserves being sold off, though the question is now who will take a hold of the profits, Muluzi has graciously offered to be the warden of the profits, though opposition parties are calling shenanigans before any decision has been made, and are demanding the profits go into the treasury directly."
 MLW_UDF.10.O1: "We trust Muluzi and his extended family with wardenship."
 MLW_UDF.10.O2: "Straight into the treasury vault it goes!"

 MLW_UDF.2.t: "Bakili and The Courts"
 MLW_UDF.2.d: "Bakili Muluzi is currently running through his second term as president of Malawi, the current consitution restricts presidents to only 2 terms, much like the United States, although the constitution of Malawi is far easier to change, in theory.\n\nMuluzi wishes to change the constitution to allow him to run for a third term. The opposition parties, most of the courts and unfortunately, a lot of the voters are against such a change, what can we do?"
 MLW_UDF.2.O1: "If only we could find a loophole..."
 MLW_UDF.2.O2: "We should put it to a referendum, like 1993!"
 MLW_UDF.2.O3: "Cram it through, Muluzi knows best!"
 MLW_UDF.2.O4: "Follow the constitution, it's what it's there for anyway."

 MLW_UDF.20.t1: "A Loophole Has Been Found!"
 MLW_UDF.20.d1: "Our top legal experts have found a loophole in the wording of the constitution that seemingly invalidates the term limitations, allowing Bakili Muluzi to run for another term without putting it to a vote or using underhanded tactics! The opposition might not enjoy it but the law is the law after all, no one can argue otherwise!"
 MLW_UDF.20.O1: "I wonder what else is invalidated in this constitution..."

 MLW_UDF.20.t2: "We Cannot Find A Loophole!"
 MLW_UDF.20.d2: "Despite our best efforts, we cannot find a loophole in the constitution regarding term limits, we can either put it to a vote now with reduced time to prepare a campaign trail, or begin to search for a successor to Muluzi ahead of the upcoming elections."
 MLW_UDF.20.O2: "Let's set up that referendum shall we?"
 MLW_UDF.20.O3: "Step aside old man!"

 MLW_UDF.20.t3: "The Campaign Trail Begins Soon!"
 MLW_UDF.20.d3: "Putting the constitutional changes to a referendum should negate a lot of the possible backlash from opposition parties and judges, if we do it legally, we aren't corrupt. Right? ...right?"
 MLW_UDF.20.O4: "It's heating up!"

 MLW_UDF.20.t4: "Opposition Parties and Populous Are Outraged!"
 MLW_UDF.20.d4: "During the most recent hearing in the National Assembly, opposition leaders from both [MLW.Neutral_conservatism_L] and [MLW.neutral_Social_L] have denounced the move to abolish term limits and are both calling for an immediate special election, they claim if we do not give them what they ask for, they will call on the people of Malawi to depose us!"
 MLW_UDF.20.O5: "Let them try, we were voted in, we will serve our term!"
 MLW_UDF.20.O6: "Let's not be too hasty, how about we compromise?"
 MLW_UDF.20.O7: "Bakili Muluzi may have brought about the end of the UDF..."

 MLW_UDF.21.t1: "How To Deal With The Loophole"
 MLW_UDF.21.d1: "Whilst a loophole has been found, our legal experts and party officials are still unsure as to how to proceed, as some of the wording of the constitution currently allows us to completely strip term limits from the presidency, if we word the amendment ambiguously enough. Many in the UDF disagree with this choice and instead wish to allow Muluzi his requested third term at the maximum, how should we proceed?"
 MLW_UDF.21.t3: "The Referendum Passes!"
 MLW_UDF.21.d3: "Our fervent campaigning for the change, thinly veiled as \"clarifying and simplifying the legal code of Malawi\" has passed, and the people and courts seem more than happy for us to rewrite however we see fit. Thanks to our ambiguous wording of the referendum, we can either strip term limits from the presidency entirely, or only allow the changes that Muluzi desires, in the form of a third term."
 MLW_UDF.21.O4: "Ambiguous wording strikes again!"
 MLW_UDF.21.O5: "Three terms is plenty for Malawi."

 MLW_UDF.21.t2: "Who Will Be The Successor?"
 MLW_UDF.21.d2: "Whilst there was some within the UDF who wanted to allow Muluzi to run for a third (or more) term, it wasn't meant to be. Now we are faced with a tough choice; who will lead the UDF going forwards?\nCassim Chilumpha is a good choice, with a background in education, he may be what Malawi needs to deal with the population boom.\nAtupele Muluzi, the son of Bakili, who will more than likely lead much like his father, though some critics are hostile to this decision of hereditary leadership.\nBingu wa Mutharika, seemingly the favoured choice, a great economist who is sure to see Malawi set up for the upcoming millennia, should the UDF hold on to power."
 MLW_UDF.21.O1: "Chilumpha can teach us a thing or two!"
 MLW_UDF.21.O2: "Keep it in the family, they know best!"
 MLW_UDF.21.O3: "Bingu will keep everyone happy!"

 MLW_UDF.21.t4: "The Referendum Fails!"
 MLW_UDF.21.d4: "Despite our best efforts, and endless campaigning, it seems as if the people of Malawi have seen through our thinly veiled attempts at continuing the Muluzi reign through a constitutional change disguised as \"clarifying and simplifying the legal code of Malawi\", we will have to start to look at the party to see who may be the next best candidate, though we have lost a decent amount of support within the voter base, who see this referendum as an attempt to erode democracy."
 MLW_UDF.21.O6: "Well, shit."

 MLW_UDF.22.t1: "Cassim Chilumpha Takes His Place"
 MLW_UDF.22.d1: "Lawyer by trade and one of Malawi's chief legal experts, Cassim Chilumpha has served the UDF and Malawi diligently in various positions, from Minister of Defence to Minister of Finance. Most important to us in the upcoming millennia is his prior position of Minister for Education, where he saw our literacy rate skyrocket to where it is today."
 MLW_UDF.22.O1: "Let's hope he can keep it up!"

 MLW_UDF.22.t2: "Atupele Muluzi Takes His Place"
 MLW_UDF.22.d2: "The first born son of Bakili Muluzi, Atupele Muluzi is as of yet, untested when it comes to politics, though an avid supporter of the UDF and a loud cheerleader for his father's policies, he may find himself struggling to maintain a grip over the UDF unless he is able to take the reins firmly and steer the UDF on the right path."
 MLW_UDF.22.O2: "Like father like son?"

 MLW_UDF.22.t3: "Bingu wa Mutharika Takes His Place"
 MLW_UDF.22.d3: "An economist by trade, Mutharika is known by most in the UDF as the favoured candidate by a considerable margin, his steadfast economic policies are hoped to bring Malawi from being a relatively unknown nation in the south of Africa to being a household name for those who wish to do business in the region."
 MLW_UDF.22.O3: "Let's get this bread"

 MLW_UDF.22.t4: "Protests Erupt In Lilongwe!"
 MLW_UDF.22.d4: "MPs from the [MLW.Neutral_conservatism_L] and [MLW.neutral_Social_L] parties have lived up to their promise and have incited the people to protest our government! Most of the population are actively calling for a special election in an attempt to remove the UDF from power! Many of the UDF's leading members are calling for us to accede to the protestors' demands, though we can always try to stay on, and hope that the protests die out on their own..."
 MLW_UDF.22.O4: "We should give way to the protestors..."
 MLW_UDF.22.O5: "Who do they think we are? Some pushover? Stay in power!"

 MLW_UDF.23.t1: "Protests Die Down"
 MLW_UDF.23.d1: "It seems the threats from both the [MLW.Neutral_conservatism_L] and [MLW.neutral_Social_L] to escalate the violence and dissent were merely empty threats, it seems as though we have gotten away with passing the changes to the constitution with very little real consequences."
 MLW_UDF.23.O1: "Thank God we got away with it."

 MLW_UDF.23.t2: "Protestors Storm The Palace!"
 MLW_UDF.23.d2: "The threats of escalation from both the [MLW.Neutral_conservatism_L] and [MLW.neutral_Social_L] have seemingly come true! The protestors have been riled up to the point they have torn open the presidential palace's gates and are actively seeking the deposition of the president! Thankfully the President was airlifted away from the baying mob, but it now seems like Malawi may be under military rule in the form of a caretaker government, with elections scheduled soon."
 MLW_UDF.23.O2: "In comes the caretakers..."

 MLW_UDF.3.t: "Private or Public Schooling?"
 MLW_UDF.3.d: "We currently have a decently sized private schooling system within Malawi, but some critics think that private schools entrench elitism and tend to breed an atmosphere of nepotism. Supporters of private schools make a very valid argument however, forcing all schools to be public is very expensive.\n\nWhat should we do?"
 MLW_UDF.3.O1: "Private schools are the way forwards."
 MLW_UDF.3.O2: "Elitism in Malawi? Not a chance!"

 MLW_UDF.4.t: "Chiefs Demand Concessions"
 MLW_UDF.4.d1: "The Chiefs have requested we kick a little cash their way, they say this will help them with assisting their people reach great heights, whatever that means..."
 MLW_UDF.4.d2: "The Chiefs have asked we make some political concessions towards them in our upcoming policy changes, they claim this will be a great help for both them and us, they didn't say how it would help us however..."
 MLW_UDF.4.d3: "The Chiefs have come to ask that we prop up some of their children's burgeoning political careers, this seems like a terrible idea on paper, but they promise to make it worth our while in the long run."
 MLW_UDF.4.O1: "We can spare some cash."
 MLW_UDF.4.O2: "They want what?"
 MLW_UDF.4.O3: "Not ideal but if it keeps them happy."
 MLW_UDF.4.O4: "They want what?"
 MLW_UDF.4.O5: "Keep this hush hush..."
 MLW_UDF.4.O6: "They want what?"

 MLW_UDF.5.t: "Chiefs Move Into New Office"
 MLW_UDF.5.d: "The Chiefs have now moved into a shiny new office in downtown Lilongwe, close to the government buildings, this should keep them happier and honestly, out of our hair, they were starting to become a nuisance.\n\nThis will allow us the chance to waste their time with inane paperwork and never ending buck passing, freeing our bureaucrats from their pointless requests."
 MLW_UDF.5.O1: "Thank God that's done with."

 MLW_UDF.6.t: "The Culture of Malawi"
 MLW_UDF.6.d: "Malawi has a long history, one of chieftains, tribes and colonialism. Today Malawi stands at an important point, a (somewhat) free and (somewhat) fair multi-party democracy, unburdened by previous autocratic rule, the people of the world see Malawi as a ways to forget their troubles, and enjoy the sights and sounds of a paradise, a jewel of Southern Africa."
 MLW_UDF.6.O1: "Have we got enough beach towels?"

 MLW_UDF.60.t: "Tourism Begins To Kick Off"
 MLW_UDF.60.d: "Before our efforts, we only had drips and drabs of tourists willing to visit our little paradise, and most of those were usually only here for the wildlife or some other research. Now it seems as though there is a steady stream of tourists coming, albeit somewhat small, they're enjoying the flavours of our wonderful nation, from Ingoma dancing to plates of chambo and nsima."
 MLW_UDF.60.O1: "Let's keep it up!"

 MLW_UDF.61.t: "A World Renowned Tourist Destination!"
 MLW_UDF.61.d: "It seems our efforts to show the world Malawian culture has paid off, and people from all over the globe have come to see the wonders of Malawi (granted the lake is our most popular destination).\n\nRegardless, the tourist industry is now alive and kicking from Blantyre to Mzuzu the streets are abuzz with all sorts of crazy foreign languages."
 MLW_UDF.61.O1: "Global Malawi, who'd have thunk it?"

 MLW_UDF.7.t: "Business Outreach Program Successes"
 MLW_UDF.7.d: "Many thought that we were spending far too much money on the small business outreach program, and they would have been right, if it weren't for the diligence and initiative shown by our wonderful populous. Would be entrepeneurs were almost clambering over each other for a chance at gaining a business grant."

 MLW_UDF.9.d: "Malawi has suffered from a dizzying lack of electrification for a long time now, and it needs to be resolved one way or the other, there are a few options at hand, but the main two schematics puts us either choosing a pragmatic, tried and true method; fossil fuel, or, alternatively, some bright minds have shown us a way of harnessing the sun, wind or water to our needs."
 MLW_UDF.9.O1: "We like another type of green energy..."

 MLW_UDF.90.O1: "Here we go!"

 # OIL
 MLW_oil.1.t: "To Drill, Or Not To Drill?"
 MLW_oil.1.d: "Ever since the first discovery of oil deposits in and around Lake Nyasa, Malawians have considered the route ahead regarding the actual use of the lake; whether to exploit this underutilised wealth of resources or to ignore it entirely and aim towards keeping the Malawian fishing sector afloat with keeping the waters clean and pollution free.\n\nIt is expected that we may agitate our neighbours who also stake claims over the region should we go ahead with drilling, but we simply cannot afford to be left behind in the millennium to come."
 MLW_oil.1.O1: "Now to make a decision..."
 MLW_oil.2.t: "Another Tough Choice"
 MLW_oil.2.d: "Our neighbours might not be happy with our decision to drill for oil, but maybe we can get someone else to drill for us? Simply offering a lucrative deal wherein our guests get a free ride in exchange for them providing us some of the oil they extract. They've even promised to share some of the dividends should it be a good year!\n\nSome of our citizens with more of a nationalist sentiment however have voiced concerns about letting a foreign power take our resources, it may be more expensive in the short term but at least we will have control over our own oilfields!"
 MLW_oil.2.O1: "They both make convincing arguments..."
 MLW_oil.20.t: "Who will be the lucky driller?"
 MLW_oil.20.d: "There are 4 contracts on your desk [MLW.GetLeader], all are offering roughly the same deal, with only slight differences, it does seem hard to pick from the bunch...\n\nSo, who is the lucky winner of the Nyasa Oilfield contract?"
 MLW_oil.20.O1: "Belt, Road and §RCNPC§!?"
 MLW_oil.20.O2: "Time to come out of our §YShell§!!"

 MLW_oil.3.t3: "[SAU.GetName] Is Furious With Us"
 MLW_oil.3.t4: "[USA.GetName] Is Furious With Us"
 MLW_oil.3.d: "Our recent decision to nationalise the Nyasa Oilfields has not gone over well with our resource extraction partner, they claim to be petitioning the nation's government to cut off ties with us entirely, leaving us high and dry.\n\nWhilst we now own the oilfields outright, many of our citizens are questioning our government's motives, with many saying that our choice to nationalise will scare off other potential investors."
 MLW_oil.3.O1: "And fall into the debt trap? No thanks!"
 MLW_oil.3.O2: "A second independence day then!"
 MLW_oil.3.O3: "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery!"
 MLW_oil.3.O4: "We don't want to risk being another airbase!"
 MLW_oil.30.t: "Foreign Oil Dividends Pay Out"
 MLW_oil.30.d: "Our resource extraction partners have made a new records in profits from our wells! At least, that's what they're telling us.\n\nNo matter! They've sent the government a paycheck to cash and have asked for a little more leeway for drilling, we should give it to them, as long as the money keeps flowing!"
 MLW_oil.30.O1: "Keep the taps flowing [CHI.GetLeader]!"
 MLW_oil.30.O2: "Smashing! Spot of tea?"

 MLW_oil.30.O4: "Is that why they're called ten gallon hats?"
 MLW_oil.31.t: "Foreign Oil Dividends Dry Up"
 MLW_oil.31.d: "Our resource extraction partners have contacted our government offices making every excuse in the book before we finally got a straight answer out of them. The promised wealth for this year's budget was a total lie, in fact, they're asking us for help as many of their workers return home without a bonus!\n\nWe have no choice but to acquiesce to their demands, after all, it was written in the contract we signed."
