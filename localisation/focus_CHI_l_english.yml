  CHI_End_PLA_Business_Ventures_desc:0 "In order to make up for defence budget cuts under Deng Xiaoping, the country’s military, the PLA, started acquiring business ventures in the 1970s. However the government has recently started to become concerned by this phenomenon due to increasing corruption in the PLA as well as the threat posed by allowing the military to gain control over a significant portion of the country’s economy. A new directive to remove the PLA from most sectors of the economy is therefore necessary, but in order to placate the military we must implement this alongside an increase in the military budget."

  CHI_Future_of_the_CPC_desc:0 "As much as the Communist Party of China likes to present itself as a strong, united entity, it is not immune to fissures along factional lines. We must choose which, if any faction we desire to favour."
  CHI_Three_Represents_Thought:0 "Three Represents Thought"
  CHI_Three_Represents_Thought_desc:0 "The “Three Represents” is a theory of what the Communist Party represents as put forward by Jiang Zemin.

  CHI_Youth_League_Dominance:0 "Communist Youth League Dominance"
  CHI_Youth_League_Dominance_desc:0 "The Chinese Communist Youth League is an influential organization that has groomed a large number of Communist Party officials, including vice-president Hu Jintao. The alumni of the organization tend to be slightly more politically liberal than other party officials, and tend to identify themselves more with the rural lower classes, striving for socioeconomic equality wherever possible. However, they are by no means pro-democracy and are willing to use force to put down insurrection if necessary."
  CHI_Preserve_CPC_Unity:0 "Preserve CPC Unity"
  CHI_Preserve_CPC_Unity_desc:0 "China cannot prosper if either the Communist Youth League or the Shanghai clique wield too much unchallenged influence. We must strive to keep both factions in check."

  CHI_Shanghai_Clique_Dominance_desc:0 "The Shanghai Clique is a political faction centred around Jiang Zemin, a grouping made up predominantly of pro-business politicians, princelings, and individuals hailing from China’s more wealthy, urban areas.

  CHI_End_Class_Warfare:0 "End Class Warfare"
  CHI_End_Class_Warfare_desc:0 "As a result of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents Thought”, the foundations of Chinese political thought have been substantially, if subtly amended. While Mao’s underlying ideology relied on class warfare in favour of the rural peasants against the urban bourgeoisie, Jiang’s more pro-business orientation has led him to favour an end to this aspect of Chinese governance in favour of an inclusion and acceptance of the Chinese business and entrepreneurial class."
