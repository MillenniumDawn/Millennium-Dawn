 italy_md.28.t: "Criminals sabotage our industries!"
 italy_md.28.d: "Earlier today we received news that our industries and infrastructures were sabotages by heavily equipped criminals. The industries were set on fire and huge explosions happened on highways. Our secret agencies discovered that the attacks are an answer from the feared leaders of the 'Mafia' who didn't take our recent actions against them lightly."

 italy_md.30.o2: "We are almost there, they won't stop us now!"
 italy_md.31.t: "Criminals sabotage our military!"
 italy_md.31.d: "Not even the military was saved from the mean sabotages.

 italy_news.2.o2: "What an Interesting Development."
 italy_news.3.t: "The Roman Empire is back!"
 italy_news.3.d: "It sounds like a writing prompt, but it is reality.

 italy_news.9.o1: "We had to"
 italy_news.9.o2: "Interesting development"
