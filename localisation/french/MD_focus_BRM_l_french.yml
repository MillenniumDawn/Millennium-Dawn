 Burma.6.d: "Our Wa allies have come under attack from the central government of Myanmar.

 Burma.14.d: "Following a growing diplomatic proximity between us and the government of [BRM.GetNameDef], the Burmese government has reached out to us with an intriguing offer.

 Burma.18.d: "The 1982 Citizenship Law was put into place to actively prevent the people of Rohingya from being considered Citizens in Myanmar. Its clauses are oppressive and actively prevent people of our great nation from feeling like they are one of us. The government has announced today that is time we reform the law and allow for the Rohingya to gain citizenship in our great nation. They will always be one of our people.\n"
 Burma.18.a: "A Great Step for Us"
 Burma_News.1.t: "A New Path for Myanmar?"
 Burma_News.1.d: "The military government today announced that the decades-long process of drafting a new constitution has finally been completed. While the new constitution marks a liberalising shift in Myanmar's politics, it nonetheless preserves the military's continued role in government, such as by ensuring its possession of 25% of the seats in parliament. It remains to be seen whether this constitution will be a vehicle for democratisation or a tool for continued military domination."

 Burma_News.2.t: "Aung San Suu Kyi Released"
 Burma_News.2.d: "After an extended period of resistance, the military government has finally caved into local and international pressure to release Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. This momentous decision follows the release of other prominent opposition politicians."

 Burma_News.3.t: "The NLD Comes to Power in Myanmar "
 Burma_News.3.d: "In a remarkable turn of events the NLD has come to government, marking the end of close to 50 years of military rule. However, commentators remain divided on whether the NLD will truly be able to steer the country in a different direction, or whether the military will continue to exercise power albeit from behind the scenes."
 Burma_News.3.a: "It had to happen eventually."
 Burma_News.4.t: "A quiet struggle for dominance"
 Burma_News.4.d: "Reports are beginning to emerge about attempts by the civilian government of Myanmar to undermine the political influence of the country's military, the Tatmadaw. While the military's material strength is undoubtedly superior, analysts predict that the civilian government will seek to undermine the military's popular support and pressure the military indirectly through supporting popular protest. How the Tatmadaw will react to these moves remains uncertain."
 Burma_News.4.a: "An uncertain path lies before this country."
 Burma_News.5.t: "An End to Peace"
 Burma_News.5.d: "[BRM.GetLeader] today proclaimed that the government will no longer pursue ceasefires with the various rebel groups fighting the central government. This marks a significant shift in policy from the government's normal cycle of ceasefires and clashes with rebel groups."
 Burma_News.5.a: "War is coming"
 Burma_News.6.t: "The [BRM.GetName]"
 Burma_News.6.d: "The nation formerly known as the Union of Myanmar has officially become a Federation, marking a major shift in the government's attitude towards the ethnic minorities that dominate its border regions. The government had previously refused to grant any significant autonomy to these regions, including the Shan, Karen and Kachin states, but after years of conflict the government has finally accepted that this policy was not viable in the long term."
 Burma_News.6.a: "This was inevitable"
 Burma_News.7.t: "Myanmar cracks down on protests"
 Burma_News.7.d: "Information coming out of Myanmar has been scarce in recent weeks but it has become clear that the government has responded violently to peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations, launching a crackdown of monumental proportions. Western leaders and the United Nations Secretary-General have vocally denounced the violence in Myanmar. China and Russia have not publicly commented on the crackdown, but have vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning the violence."
 Burma_News.7.a: "How awful!"
 Burma_News.7.b: "It had to happen eventually"
 Burma_News.8.t: "The Insurgency has been Crushed"
 Burma_News.8.d: "Today [BRM.GetLeader] announced the last of Myanmar's ethnic rebellions has been wiped out. After decades of fighting, the government's adoption of a new strategy towards the insurgency, focusing on each remaining rebel group one at a time and refusing any possibility of compromise, has finally brought the conflict to a close. However, this achievement has come at a cost. Myanmar's relations with China have been perhaps irrevocably damaged by the military campaign. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have taken refuge within China's borders and dozens of Chinese citizens have been killed or injured by the fighting, not to mention China's chagrin at having its close ally, the United Wa State Army, shattered by the tatmadaw. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether the ethnic minorities now under military occupation will continue to accept the rule of the central government if all that is compelling them to do so is fear of the military's brutality."
 Burma_News.8.a: "Peace in our time?"
 Burma_News.9.t: "ASEAN Mutual Defence Treaty Signed"

 Insurgency.11.t: "The government has offered us a ceasefire"
 Insurgency.11.d: "Clearly in awe of our military prowess, the cowardly Tatmadaw has requested a cessation of hostilities. As despicable as our enemies are, a ceasefire may also be in our own interests, as we can use this opportunity to push for concessions from the Burmese."
 Insurgency.11.a: "We should make ambitious demands."
 Insurgency.11.b: "We should make moderate demands."
 Insurgency.11.c: "Screw them, we should reject their offer."
 Insurgency.12.t: "The rebels are pushing for outrageously large concessions!"

 Insurgency.12.a: "Accept their demands"
 Insurgency.12.b: "Reject their demands"
 Insurgency.13.t: "The rebels are making reasonable demands"
 Insurgency.13.d: "These demands are tolerable, and give us a lot of room to maneuver. However, agreeing to them would make us forego the possibility of making gains on the field of battle for the foreseeable future."
 Insurgency.13.a: "Accept their demands"

 Insurgency.16.t: "The government has rejected our demands"
 Insurgency.16.d: "The traitorous scum that is the Tatmadaw has gone back on their earlier offer of peace, leaving us with no choice but to continue the struggle against them."
 Insurgency.16.a: "The struggle continues."
 Insurgency.18.t: "The government has invited us to negotiations of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement"
 Insurgency.18.d: "The new government has announced an ambitious proposal to make peace with all of the major ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) in Myanmar. We are among one of the 15 largest groups that have been invited to the negotiations. If we attend these talks, we will have a seat at the table in what could be the negotiations that shape the future of Myanmar."
 Insurgency.18.a: "Let's see how this goes."
 Insurgency.18.b: "This is a waste of time."
 Insurgency.19.t: "The First Round of Negotiations"
 Insurgency.19.d: "One of the most significant issues regarding the conflict in Myanmar is whether the state of Myanmar should be a union or a federation. Historically, the Burmese government has refused to accept the possibility of Myanmar becoming a federation, as, painfully aware of the legacy of colonial divide-and-rule, it fears that such a move would lead to the disintegration of the country. The ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) on the other hand have insisted on the need for a more representative form of government. Going forward in these negotiations, we should establish what our negotiation position on this particular issue is."
 Insurgency.19.a: "We must preserve the Union."
 Insurgency.19.b: "Times are changing and so must we, we should become a Federation."
 Insurgency.19.c: "We should compromise on this point."
 Insurgency.20.t: "The Second Round of Negotiations"
 Insurgency.20.d: "The next issue on the agenda concerns the composition of the Tatmadaw. Many EAOs argue that the nation's armed forces cannot be overwhelmingly dominated by Buddhists and ethnic Burmans as it is at the moment. We must consider whether or not to address these concerns."
 Insurgency.20.a: "Keep to the status quo."
 Insurgency.20.b: "Commit ourselves to improving minority representation in the military."
 Insurgency.20.c: "This issue is too significant to decide right now."
 Insurgency.21.t: "The Final Round of Negotiations"
 Insurgency.21.d: "The biggest stumbling block that we have encountered in these negotiations is whether to pursue disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) or security sector reform (SSR). The Tatmadaw has historically preferred DDR due to its desire to completely disarm the EAOs or bring them under its own command. The EAOs however have preferred SSR, a framework which would allow them to be integrated into the country's security sector whilst keeping their arms and their autonomy. We should consider the best solution to this impasse."
 Insurgency.21.a: "They cannot keep their arms. We choose DDR."
 Insurgency.21.b: "We must make some sacrifices, and so will accept SSR."
 Insurgency.21.c: "This issue is too important to decide at this moment."
 Insurgency.22.t: "We are satisfied with this draft"
 Insurgency.22.d: "The government has made enough concessions for us to bring this signed draft back to our people and carry ourselves with pride."
 Insurgency.22.a: "We will sign."
 Insurgency.23.t: "This draft is not acceptable!"
 Insurgency.23.d: "The government and the military clearly have no desire to draft an agreement worth any more than the paper is printed on! If we were to take this back to our people they would surely skin us alive."
 Insurgency.23.a: "We will not sign!"
 Insurgency.24.t: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has signed the NCA!"
 Insurgency.24.d: "Finding our negotiation position tolerable, the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has joined us in signing this historic document."
 Insurgency.24.a: "Merveilleux !"
 Insurgency.25.t: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has refused to sign the NCA!"
 Insurgency.25.d: "Citing our 'unreasonable' demands, the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has refused to join us in signing this historic document."
 Insurgency.25.a: "Their loss."
 Insurgency.26.t: "Shan rebels have attacked our financial interests!"
 Insurgency.26.d: "Clearly trying to curry favour with Thailand and other states, the Shan rebels have taken it upon themselves to undermine our drug-trafficking capabilities. We must decide on a suitable response to this aggression, with possibilities ranging from doing nothing at all to attacking some of their strongholds or even declaring all-out war."
 Insurgency.26.a: "This means war!"
 Insurgency.26.b: "Our response should be proportionate."
 Insurgency.26.c: "We cannot respond at this point in time."
 Insurgency.27.t: "The United Wa State Army has retaliated!"
 Insurgency.27.d: "In response to our attacks on their drug trafficking assets, the UWSA has launched attacks on some of our border outposts. While we managed to repel them, we have suffered some casualties."
 Insurgency.27.a: "Regrettable."

The balance between peace and war is a delicate one, and it is one that both sides must handle carefully.\n\nThe level of influence Myanmar has in any particular EAO determines whether Myanmar can annex the rebel territory or whether the breakaway state can declare independence.

 BRM_annex_WAA_desc: "We have acquired enough influence over the Wa to completely take over their territory."
 attack_drug_factories: "Attack Wa Drug Factories"
 attack_drug_factories_desc: "The United Wa State Army is heavily involved in the illegal production of drugs like heroin and \"ya ba\", a meth tablet. Attacking and destroying these factories will require effort and resources, but it will help our international legitimacy and with it, our cause. However, we must be prepared for the Wa to retaliate against us."
 intercept_drug_convoys: "Intercept Wa Drug Convoys"
 intercept_drug_convoys_desc: "Our position on the Thai border means we can intercept drugs being transferred from Wa territory to Thailand. Confiscating these drugs and burning them in front of Thai and international news organizations will increase international opinion of our group but may prompt a military response from the United Wa State Army."
 end_opium_production: "End Heroin Production"
 end_opium_production_desc: "The United States has labeled our organization as a narcotics trafficker and has issued arrest warrants for some of our top commanders. More importantly, China also disapproves of our involvement in the heroin trade and so, while it may hurt our economy, it may be in our best interests to ban cultivation of opium poppies and end heroin production."
 end_meth_production: "End \"Ya Ba\" Production"
 end_meth_production_desc: "Ya ba is a methamphetamine tablet that is a major source of funding for us and helps support our economy. However, it makes it difficult for us to shake off our negative reputation, particularly in relation to Thailand where ya ba has become widespread. We may have to accept the short-term economic shocks from ending ya ba production if we want to be viewed positively by the international community."
 attack_tatmadaw: "Attack the Tatmadaw"
 attack_tatmadaw_desc: "The central government does not seem to want to leave us in peace. To ensure the safety of our people we must strike at the hated Tatmadaw before they can come into our own homes."
 declare_independence: "Declare Independence"
 declare_independence_desc: "We have freed ourselves enough from the Burman's oppressive yoke to call for international recognition of our own independent state."
 BRM_sangha_category: "Buddhism Policy"
 BRM_sangha_category_desc: "To keep the opinion of the country's Buddhist monks, also known as the sangha, favourable to the government, we must ensure that Buddhist institutions in Myanmar have sufficient funding. However, the sangha may refuse to accept our patronage, a possibility that increases the lower their opinion of us is."
 BRM_impose_state_religion: "Make Buddhism our State Religion"
 BRM_impose_state_religion_desc: "Since 90% of the nation is Buddhist by faith, it is only natural for us to make that religious reality a political one too. This move may antagonise our religious minorities, but it will win us the support of the sangha."
 BRM_remove_state_religion: "Return to Having no State Religion"
 BRM_remove_state_religion_desc: "We must accept that imposing a state religion has not been to our advantage. The antagonisation of various minorities has far outstripped the benefits from the increased support of a few Buddhist nationalists."
 BRM_minor_funding: "Minor Funding for Buddhist Institutions"
 BRM_minor_funding_desc: "We cannot afford to give more than a small amount to support Buddhism in Myanmar. This has a low chance of increasing the sangha's opinion of us."
 BRM_moderate_funding: "Moderate Funding for Buddhist Institutions"
 BRM_moderate_funding_desc: "We can afford to make more substantial donations to the monks of Myanmar. This has a medium chance of increasing the sangha's opinion of us."
 BRM_major_funding: "Major Funding for Buddhist Institutions"
 BRM_major_funding_desc: "We must spare no expense when it comes to spiritual matters. This has a high chance of increasing the sangha's opinion of us."
 BRM_no_influence: "0%"
 BRM_Administrative_Decisions: "Administrative Decisions"
 BRM_Administrative_Decisions_desc: "Our military strategists have concluded that having Yangon as capital leaves us vulnerable to the possibility of an amphibious invasion. Relocating the capital to a more remote location would, in the event of a war with a stronger foreign power, allow the Tatmadaw to organize guerrilla warfare from a secure command post."
