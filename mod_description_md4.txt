The world is changing. Globalization, terrorism, climate change. The list goes on and on. As countries vie for supremacy in this new millennium, can you lead your nation to prosperity through the decades ahead? Or will you stumble through the trials of the 21st century?

We're proud to be the only modern day Hearts of Iron mod that can tick all of the boxes above. This is a very solid base on which to build great, dynamic, and exciting gameplay.

So, we have built a solid base, but the mod is—like most others—NOT finished. In this early release, we aim for a fun gameplay experience for the first few years, especially in the Middle East. When you are finished, please reload and try a different country.

Future updates will add more content across the board. Decisions, dynamic events, politics, focuses, more conflicts, and all that exciting geopolitical action we know you love and crave.

[h1][b]Disclaimer![/b][/h1]
Do not use other mods or submods with this mod unless the author of the submod has specifically stated that their submod works with MD4. Any crash/bug reports or balance issues made while running other active mods will be ignored. Please write to us about errors, but specify as many details as possible—otherwise it is not helpful. This mod does not require DLC to play but the MD4 team highly recommends having all DLC to get the full experience.
