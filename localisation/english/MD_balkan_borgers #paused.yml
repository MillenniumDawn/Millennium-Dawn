One of the most infamous incidents occurred at Pristina Airport in June 1999, where British General Sir Mike Jackson refused NATO Supreme Commander Wesley Clark’s order to forcibly remove Russian troops who had seized the airport first, stating, 'I'm not going to start World War III for you.' This tense standoff highlighted the fragile nature of post-war operations. Meanwhile, German General Helmut Harff faced a confrontation with a Serbian border officer who demanded that German troops withdraw. Harff, remaining calm, gave the officer 30 minutes to comply. When the officer protested, an argument ensued—Harff simply responded, 'Now it’s 28.' These moments underscored the high tensions in the region and the delicate balance NATO had to maintain to prevent further conflict."
