  CHI_End_PLA_Business_Ventures_desc:0 "In order to make up for defence budget cuts, the country’s military, the PLA, started acquiring business ventures in the 1970s. However the government has recently started to become concerned by this phenomenon. A new directive to remove the PLA from most sectors of the economy is therefore necessary, but in order to placate the military we must implement this alongside an increase in the budget."

  CHI_Future_of_the_CPC_desc:0 "As much as the Communist Party of China likes to present itself as a strong, united entity, it is not immune to fissures along factional lines. We must choose which, if any faction we desire to favour."

  CHI_End_Class_Warfare_desc:0 "As a result of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents Thought”, the foundations of Chinese political thought have been substantially, if subtly amended. While Mao’s underlying ideology relied on class warfare in favour of the rural peasants against the urban bourgeoisie, Jiang’s more pro-business orientation has led him to favour an end to this aspect of Chinese governance."

  CHI_Peaceful_Rise:0 "China's Peaceful Rise"
  CHI_Peaceful_Rise_desc:0 "The perception of China as a threat to international peace and security is not uncommon in the US and amongst our neighbours. To counter this, we should adopt the official policy of “China’s peaceful rise” or, to put it in an even less threatening way, “China’s peaceful development”. This will assure our Western and regional partners that we do not seek conflict."

  CHI_Scientific_Outlook_on_Development_desc:0 "In many ways a backlash by Hu Jintao against the growth-centric focus of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, the “Scientific Outlook on Development” is the theoretical underpinning of Hu’s government, one that focuses on sustainable growth that minimizes environmental pollution and socioeconomic inequality."

  CHI_Green_GDP_desc:0 "A key tenet of the scientific outlook on development is sustainability.

  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Agenda_desc:0 "The strengthening of the Shanghai Clique has paved the way for Jiang Zemin’s so-called “hatchet man” to assume leadership of the Communist Party and the nation.

  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Thought_desc:0 "Building upon Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, Zeng has formulated a new ideological underpinning for the CPC, one that stresses the duty of the party to represent the majority of Chinese people.

  CHI_Intra_Party_Democracy_desc:0 "One of Zeng Qinghong’s key ideas is that of intra-party democracy, in which elections are used to select local-level party secretaries.

  CHI_Public_Examinations_desc:0 "In order to fill the Communist Party apparatus with the most competent officials possible, Zeng has ordered that all lower-level posts should be filled through rigorous public examinations rather than by appointment.

  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Agenda:0 "Xi Jinping's Agenda"
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Agenda_desc:0 "With Bo Xilai out of the way, the path is clear for a smooth transition of power to vice-president Xi Jinping.

  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Thought:0 "Xi Jinping Thought"
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Thought_desc:0 "Xi Jinping's contribution to the theoretical basis of the CPC's rule is one that establishes a large number of lofty goals for the party.

  CHI_Flowing_Spring:0 "Flowing Spring"
  CHI_Flowing_Spring_desc:0 "Taking his Chinese Dream to the next level, Xi Jinping has drawn on a poem from the 8th century BCE entitled "Flowing Spring" which concerns regaining greatness and prosperity.

  CHI_Anti_Corruption_Campaigns_desc:0 "The time has come for us to start securing our grip on power. Many political rivals of [CHI.GetLeader] remain politically active and constitute a threat, however slim, to our government.

  CHI_Weaken_the_Youth_League_desc:0 "The populist coalition headed by the Tuanpai or Youth League Faction retains significant influence due to the significant degree of independence possessed by the Communist Youth League. By reducing this independence and conducting bribery investigations against Youth League members such as Ling Jihua, we can make the Youth League cease to be an important force in Chinese politics."

  CHI_Take_Down_the_Big_Tigers_desc:0 "The elitist coalition, dominated by "princelings" and Jiang Zemin's Shanghai clique, retains a large number of high-ranking posts in the CPC. Luckily for us, a large number of this officials are involved in corruption due to the nepotism of Jiang Zemin's government.

  CHI_War_on_Crime:0 "War on Crime"
  CHI_War_on_Crime_desc:0 "During his time as Party secretary of Chongqing, Bo Xilai made fighting organized crime one of his top priorities. Now that he can extend his method of governing to the entire country, it is high time that the corrupt businessmen and triad bosses in the rest of the country meet the same fates as their Chongqing-based brethren."
  CHI_The_Chongqing_Model:0 "The Chongqing Model"
  CHI_The_Chongqing_Model_desc:0 "The Chongqing Model is Bo Xilai's contribution to Communist Party doctrine. It is a model that includes a wide range of social and economic policies, including "strike black" and "sing red" campaigns that involve fighting organized crime and singing communist songs respectively.

  CHI_JASIC_Labor_Reforms_desc:0 "Labor disputes are a significant hinderance to the government's legitimacy. Workers at Jasic Technology in particular have sought to unionize in order to fight for their rights.

  CHI_Humanist_Marxism:0 "Humanist Marxism"
  CHI_Humanist_Marxism_desc:0 "The "New Left" ideology put forward by Bo Xilai and others is one that favours a return to aspects of Maoist socialism such as state-planning and collectivism. Now that he has come to power, Bo can pursue his leftist agenda under the banner of "humanist marxism"."
  CHI_Nanjie_Model:0 "The Nanjie Model"
  CHI_Nanjie_Model_desc:0 "In many ways a development of the Chongqing model, the Nanjie model retains many elements of Bo's original theory but draws on the example of Nanjie village, a stronghold of Maoism that retains a collectivist system. Bo's Nanjie model calls on China to heed Nanjie's example, and leave behind capitalism and the free-market in favour of true socialism."
  CHI_Purge_Tuanpai:0 "Purge the Tuanpai"

  CHI_Promote_Princelings_desc:0 "While the venerable members of Jiang Zemin's Shanghai clique have served China well, it is time for them to retire and make way for a new generation of leaders.

  CHI_Bo_Xilai_Agenda:0 "Bo Xilai's Agenda"
  CHI_Bo_Xilai_Agenda_desc:0 "Following the rise to power of the princelings and the political chaos that followed the purge of the Youth League faction, Bo Xilai has managed to come out on top by distinguishing himself from his fellow princelings with his ardent "New Left" ideology. Bo will now be free to pursue his somewhat controversial vision for Chinese politics."
  CHI_Scrap_Military_Commands:0 "Scrap Military Commands"
  CHI_Scrap_Military_Commands_desc:0 "The PLA's seven military commands are overly cumbersome and would hinder the ability of different units to coordinate in the event of a large-scale conflict. To remedy this, we should regroup these military commands into four strategic zones: North, South, East and West. However, this change will not come without consequences, as many military officers will resist this disruption."
  CHI_Cut_Ground_Troop_Numbers:0 "Cut Ground Troop Numbers"
  CHI_Cut_Ground_Troop_Numbers_desc:0 "Quantity is not an issue for the PLA, but quality is. Moreover, the PLA Ground Forces dwarf the other arms of the military, meaning we are burdened with an overly landlocked, cumbersome force. In order to make our military more mobile, nimble, and responsive, we should reduce our reliance on the ground forces by cutting troop numbers."
  CHI_Stamp_Out_Corruption:0 "Stamp Out Corruption"
  CHI_Stamp_Out_Corruption_desc:0 "One of the biggest hurdles to making the PLA a modern military on par with those of the West is corruption. We should use the Central Military Commission to crackdown on any signs of corruption that we can find."

  CHI_De_Politicize_the_Military_desc:0 "While the PLA's loyalty to the CPC ensures the security and stability of our one-party state, it is undeniable that this politicization of the military has, at least in part, diminished the ability of the PLA to function as an effective war-fighting force."

  CHI_Let_a_Hundred_Flowers_Bloom_desc:0 "In 1956, Mao Zedong initiated the Hundred Flowers Campaign, calling for Chinese citizens to openly air their grievances towards the government. While that campaign ended in repression and a return to the status quo, a reboot of the same campaign does not necessarily have to end the same way."
  CHI_Freedom_of_Speech:0 "Freedom of Speech"

  CHI_Question_the_Four_Cardinal_Principles_desc:0 "Deng Xiaoping's Four Cardinal Principles included upholding the socialist path, the people's democratic dictatorship, the leadership of the CPC and Maozedong thought. The inclusion of these principles means that debate about the nature of authoritarian rule in China has not been allowed. If our country is to progress, this should be amended to help diversify debate on China's future."

  CHI_Unchain_the_8_Democratic_Parties_desc:0 "While the Communist Party dominates Chinese politics, 8 other legal parties exist as part of the country's political system. However, up until now they have had little influence over policy and lack an independent voice.

  CHI_Yarlung_Tsangpo_Diversion_Project_desc:0 "Building a dam in the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon will provide China with hydroelectric power and help divert water to regions of China where water is scarce. However, such a project could lead to large-scale environmental destruction, displacement of people, and provoke a hostile reaction from India and Bangladesh who would now have reduced access to water were a diversion to take place."
  CHI_Water_Conservation_Projects:0 "Water Conservation Projects"
  CHI_Water_Conservation_Projects_desc:0 "Water is an essential resource, and we should do our best to conserve what little we have. Our government should initiate projects to reduce water consumption significantly as well as to improve the quality of our existing water resources."

  CHI_Construct_Nuclear_Waste_Repository:0 "Construct a Nuclear Waste Repository"
  CHI_Construct_Nuclear_Waste_Repository_desc:0 "The disposal of high-level radioactive waste, such as spent nuclear fuel, remains a major consideration resulting from our nuclear energy program. High-level waste has to be treated with extreme care and stored in a geological repository for decades for it to decay. We have identified the Beishan area of the Gobi desert as a suitable location to begin constructing such a repository."
  CHI_Cheap_Coal_Supremacy:0 "Cheap Coal Supremacy"
  CHI_Cheap_Coal_Supremacy_desc:0 "China is the largest producer and consumer of coal in the world and our economy continues to rely on it.

  CHI_Jing_Jin_Ji_Megacity_desc:0 "The Northern-most counterpart to the PRD is the Jing-Jin-Ji metropolitan region, an urban cluster that includes the increasingly interconnected provinces of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. Our "Jing-jin-ji" strategy will seek to maximize the economic potential of the three urban centers that make up the region by playing to each province's advantages."
  CHI_Yangtze_River_Megacity:0 "Yangtze River Megacity"
  CHI_Yangtze_River_Megacity_desc:0 "To the North and South lie significant and growing economic centers. But for millennia the Yangtze river has been the lifeblood of the Chinese nation and the cities that sprung up around it have been the heartland of Chinese government, economy, and culture.

  CHI_Xinjiang_Development_Plan:0 "Xinjiang Development Plan"
  CHI_Xinjiang_Development_Plan_desc:0 "The province of Xinjiang is without doubt the most troublesome of China's regions. Opposition to the government, terrorism and other forms of Uighur resistance continue to frustrate our control over this far-western territory.
