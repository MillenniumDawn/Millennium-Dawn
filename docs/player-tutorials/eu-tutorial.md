# Chapter 1 - The European Union

The European Union (EU) is a unique economic and political union between European member states.

The European Union is similar to a confederation, where many policy areas are federalized into common institutions capable of making law; however, the member states are sovereign nations but they have limited their sovereignty and transferred some of their powers to the supranational union.

What began as a purely economic union has evolved into an organization spanning policy areas, from climate, environment and health to external relations and security, justice and migration. A name change from the European Economic Community (EEC) to the European Union (EU) in 1993 reflected this.

# Chapter 1.1 - The European Union in Millennium Dawn

In Millennium Dawn the European Union is not a playable nation (there is an EUU tag for some coding reasons, but this is not a regular Hearts of Iron country). In the mod the EU is represented and played by the member states. Later in the game the player has the possibility to unite (annex) the member states under one cosmetic tag. Two main factors that drive the EU are the influence on the other member states and the Euroscepticism. Besides that, the EU is controlled via the EU Focus Tree and Decisions.

# Chapter 1.2 - The European Institutions

The European Union has six main institutions:

·         the European Parliament (EP)

·         the European Council

·         the Council of the European Union

·         the European Commission

·         the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)

·         the European Central Bank (ECB)

In the EU's unique institutional set-up:

·         the EU's broad priorities are set by the European Council, which brings together national and EU-level leaders

·         directly elected MEPs represent European citizens in the European Parliament

·         the interests of the EU as a whole are promoted by the European Commission, whose members are appointed by national governments and

·         governments defend their own country's national interests in the Council of the European Union.
