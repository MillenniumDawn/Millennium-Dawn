However, the Chinese government's need to avoid rising domestic inflation made aid to the DPRK unsustainable, and the DPRK was left completely without external support and in economic difficulty, with food production declining significantly.

And some women have become involved in these economic activities, bringing about a change in gender roles in North Korean society.
