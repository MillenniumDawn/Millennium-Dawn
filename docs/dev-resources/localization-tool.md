This is a tool to help process missing/duplicated/unused loc

Unused part is a bit messy, and will require a lot of manual walkthrough

How to use:
- Download archive
- Unpack it
- Install .net 6.0 runtime https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0
- launch exe file
- follow commands, enter loc folder (your_mod/localisation most likely), use command from the list
- output will be in folder in file named output.txt, it is overwritten every time app is launched so do 1 run at time
