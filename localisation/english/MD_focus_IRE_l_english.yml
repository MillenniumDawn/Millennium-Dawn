 IRE_Aontu_Housing_desc: "Ireland is suffering from a prolonged National Housing Emergency. The level of human misery being caused is unprecedented in housing terms. Up to 1 million people are in housing crisis either through mortgage distress, homelessness, spending years on housing waiting lists or grossly unaffordable rents and mortgages. This crisis has been going on so long that the media and the political establishment have become desensitised to it."

 IRE_Aontu_EastWestUnity: "Unity"
 IRE_Aontu_EastWestUnity_desc: "Aontú, our party’s name, is Irish for ‘Unity’ and ‘Agreement’. We chose that name because we seek to unify Ireland – not only north and south, but also east and west.

 IRE_Aontu_IndustryCork_desc: "Ireland is becoming a city state. The population size of Dublin in proportion to the rest of the country is decidedly imbalanced in comparison with other countries in Europe.

 IRE_Aontu_IndustryGalway: "Industralize Galway"
 IRE_Aontu_IndustryGalway_desc: "Ireland is becoming a city state.

 IRE_Aontu_UpgradeIrishRail_desc: "The Irish Rail service as it stands is subpar. Donegal, and Mayo, two large counties with a proportinate population have no rail service at all. Significant investment is needed to fix the failing rail service."
 IRE_Aontu_NationalInfrastructure: "National Infrastructure Plan"
 IRE_Aontu_NationalInfrastructure_desc: "Ireland is second from the bottom of the EU in infrastructure spend. A renewal of disadvantaged regions which have not benefitted proportionately from government EU funded spending will require significant additional investment. The key to resolving this imbalance lies in significantly increased investment regionally. Firstly existing infrastructural demands need to be met. Infrastructure also needs to be built to disrupt current demand patterns and provide for future spatially balanced demand that does not exist currently. A special formula or weighting mechanism must also be provided for the provision of infrastructure in strategic locations in the rest of the state."
 IRE_Aontu_PortOfDonegalAndCork: "The Ports of Donegal and Cork"
 IRE_Aontu_PortOfDonegalAndCork_desc: "Donegal and Cork are in excellent posistions to build a port, both Militarliy and Economically. The Port of Donegal serves as an excellent port to control access to the Irish Sea with, as well as merchant trading with the Nordic nations. The port of Cork allows us to trade in higher volumes with the European Union, while simultaneously restricting access to the Irish Sea from the South."
 IRE_Aontu_WestCoastPorts: "West Coast Ports"
 IRE_Aontu_WestCoastPorts_desc: "The Cities of Galway and Sligo are in a prime posistion for our new ports. More efficent trading with the United States and Canada would provide an economic boost for the Nation, however there is little to gain Militarily from building ports here."
 IRE_Aontu_VacantPropertyTax: "Vacant Property Tax"
 IRE_Aontu_VacantPropertyTax_desc: "1 in every 33 houses in the state is vacant. This is a shockingly high rate of vacancy in a housing crisis. A carrot and stick approach needs to be employed to get these houses in to circulation. Funding must be made available to allow home owners who cannot afford to get housing fit for habitation to do so. The state must seek to buy some of these houses and return them to occupancy. It also must be accompanied with a Vacant Property Tax to be applied to vacant houses where owners for no good reason allow a house to remain vacant."
 IRE_Aontu_EmpowerTenantsRights: "Empower Tenants Rights"
 IRE_Aontu_EmpowerTenantsRights_desc: "Due to the dysfunction within the market and the lack of tenants’ rights within the law, many tenants are living in poor conditions, paying exorbitant rents and suffering due to the precarious nature of contracts. Indeed most of the people presenting as homeless are coming from the private rental sector. A number of reforms in this sector will stem this human tide. Greater security of tenure must be provided. Tenancies of indefinite duration must be provided for. The grounds of sale should be removed from the Residential Tenancies Act. A rent cap tied to the inflation rate must be provided for. “Buy to Let” landlords who achieved tax breaks from the state should be prevented from issuing vacant possession 'Notices to Quit'."
 IRE_Aontu_SocialHousing: "Social and Affordable Housing"
 IRE_Aontu_SocialHousing_desc: "It is paramount that the government reduce the approval, tendering and procurement process for the building of public housing. Local Authority must be tasked with the development of mixed income public housing estates with Affordable Purchase homes, Affordable Cost rental and Social housing. Approved Housing Bodies have been to the fore of the delivery and management of Social Housing. They need to have their capacity and ability to deliver more enhanced."
 IRE_Aontu_InviteBigTech: "Encourage Multinational Companies"
 IRE_Aontu_InviteBigTech_desc: "Corporate Tax (CT) accounts for about 15% of total tax revenue. Nonetheless, Multinational Companies (MNC) pay 80% of CT, contributing to the funding of our public services. These are all important measures in terms of our national welfare. The reality underlying all of this is that MNC’s are mobile.  They operate within a highly competitive environment, both within the EU and globally.  They have options in terms of where to locate."
 IRE_Aontu_BanRiverFishing: "Ban River Fishing"
 IRE_Aontu_BanRiverFishing_desc: "The native freshwater fish population in many of Irelands rivers has been decimated by netting, sewage, silting and agricultural pollutants. Half of Ireland’s rivers have had angling prohibited due to lack of fish stock, though angling in itself is not a major contributory factor due to the very low return. Many of the problems lie in coastal fish farming where disease and lice breed and spread to the wild fish stocks. Mortality of salmon stocks at sea has increased due to fish farming and fishing practices so that only a tiny fraction of salmon are now returning to our Irish rivers to spawn. This all has a negative impact on our ecosystem but also on our tourism and organic, wild caught produce."
 IRE_Aontu_FishingQuotas: "Environmentally Sustainable Fishing Quotas"
 IRE_Aontu_FishingQuotas_desc: "Fishing is worth about €700 million a year to the Irish economy. However, the enviormental instability this causes is catastrophic to the nation. We must implement quotas in order to protect wildlife, while simultaneously protecting the economy."
 IRE_Aontu_NBP: "National Broadband Plan"
 IRE_Aontu_NBP_desc: "The National Broadband Plan (NBP) is a national failure. The Fine Gael government is simply not able to manage large infrastructural projects. The failure to manage the cost of the National Childrens Hospital is mirrored in a similar failure to manage the NBP. Between them, these failures will cost the Irish people billions of euro. The projected cost of the National Broadband Plan is now anything between €500 million and €3 billion. The procurement process started in 2012 and has still not been completed. The technology is moving faster than procurement and, as a result, a number of private sector firms are already making provisions for broadband supply into much of what was covered by the NBP."
 IRE_Aontu_PublicBank: "Public Banking System"
 IRE_Aontu_PublicBank_desc: "The current government has created a near banking duopoly where two banks control some 85% of the market.  Even in an era of on-line banking, this gives these banks very significant ‘supplier power’ over the costs and availability of credit.  There are also “switching costs”.  All of this bears especially heavily on SME’s and start-ups. The reality confronting Irish enterprises is that the very necessary stabilisation of the banking system has not been accompanied by a conscious effort on the part of the banks to re-imagine their role in repairing the damage inflicted by their behaviour on lives, businesses and the national interest. The best solution to this is a Public Banking System that coexists alongside the other systems, such as the one in Germany."
 IRE_Aontu_PrivateBank: "Encourage Private Banking"
 IRE_Aontu_PrivateBank_desc: "The current government has created a near banking duopoly where two banks control some 85% of the market.  Even in an era of on-line banking, this gives these banks very significant ‘supplier power’ over the costs and availability of credit.  There are also “switching costs”.  All of this bears especially heavily on SME’s and start-ups. The reality confronting Irish enterprises is that the very necessary stabilisation of the banking system has not been accompanied by a conscious effort on the part of the banks to re-imagine their role in repairing the damage inflicted by their behaviour on lives, businesses and the national interest. The best solution to this is encouraging International Private Banks to set up in Ireland and reduce the monopoly."
 IRE_Aontu_PoachTDs: "Poach TDs from the other Parties"
 IRE_Aontu_PoachTDs_desc: "Aontú is in a good posistion. Some TDs from Fine Fail, Finna Gael and Sinn Fein are staunchly anti-abortion. These TDs can be swayed over to our side."
 IRE_Aontu_Stormont: "Stregnthen our Power in Stormont"
 IRE_Aontu_Stormont_desc: "Aontú is a cross border party. If we want to become the real party of Unity, we must have proper representation and stregnth in the North."

Aontú will fight for the economic supports necessary so that all parents have the confidence to raise their children to their full potential. We will fight to take mothers out of food, housing and healthcare poverty in all cases."

 IRE_ForeginAffairs_Africa_PeaceInEthopia_desc: "The current situations in Ethopia and Eritera are grim for the population. We must deploy a peacekeeper force to assist the peace process and protect civillians.\n\nThis is also a valuable oppurtunity for our troops to gain experience."
 IRE_ForeginAffairs_Africa_PeaceInLiberia: "Deploy Peacekeepers to Liberia"
 IRE_ForeginAffairs_Africa_PeaceInLiberia_desc: "The current situation in Liberia is grim for the population. The civil war is a humanitarian crisis. A UN Peacekeeper force is deploying, and we should send the Army Ranger Wing with them."

 IRE_AbolishJobseekers: "Abolish Jobseekers Benefits"
 IRE_AbolishJobseekers_desc: "In the state people who do not work are paid by the state. Many live off this for life. This benefit was intended to help people, but it is now used to fund drug addictions and spice bags. It is time we end this."

 IRE_DoleBrigades_desc: "Continually many people refuse to work and rather live of of Social Welfare. We can simply solve this by giving them 3 options. A. College. B. Work. C. Conscription to the Defense Forces.\n\nThis however may come at a cost to our troops effectiveness."
