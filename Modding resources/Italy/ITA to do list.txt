TO DO LIST

STUFF TO FIX
-rewrite stuff using arrays
-fix values being lost due to rounding in reform expectance change calculations
-make romanization decision consistent with each other (also fix the fact that you can take multiple at a time which i think isnt intended)
(even tho it's more a pain than a gain idk)
-modify space gui to include more info
-balance recuitrable population numbers in the tree

MAJOR MECHANICS
-Member of Parliament mechanic with actual chambers n shit for a better representation of government crisis
(freboot eurpean parliament UI) (or gui if that is done in the future)

-flesh out more the choice to get a party in power in the focus tree 
(political campaigns in the democratic branch, coups, revolts, foreign interference whatever in the non democratic)
ideally using a system of opposing values (free market - interventionism ) (progressivness - traditionalism) ( welfare state - ancap memes )
thresholds in this value would modify the popularity of parties and the amount of popularity gained by enacting or repelling policies.
(example: italy start with the population highly favoring interventionism: enacting a privatization policy will greatly lower popularity while
a nationalization policy would increase popularity. At the same time interventionist parties would get a daily popolarity gain while free market parties a slight malus.
Focuses in the tree would be used to campaign to shift those value around, for example to get liberals in power a campaign to lower interventionism
sentiment should be made so that overtime liberal popularity would grow and eventually they could be elected and have their policies enacted actually give popularity.
On the other hand forcing them into the government through boost should still be possible, but will have them govern in a situation where
their popularity will quickly decay both passively and because of their policies being enacted.

-move policy to scripted gui / ui / decision category ui as to allow greater flexibility in handling them
(example cherry picking policies to keep when changing a government through policy change)
of course introduce mutually exclusive check in the system to prevent opposite policies to be active at the same time

-military focus rework
-european-wide projects for military vehicles and ships (optional)(will need papinian help for that probably)

MAFIA
-Adapt focus tree cost to regional mafia strength instead of using the average for all mafia branches
-make a meme tree where mafia takes over the country (super low priority)
-pictures for the scripted mafia gui (low priority)
-balance numbers to have mafia stay between 0.4 and 0.7 if no focuses are taken
-Instead of 1 event per region every 3 months make 1 small and 1 medium event per region each year and 1 big every some years
- increase the pool of events for every region (instead of calabria being always drugs, sicily being always migrants ecc)

PARTIES
-make parties in the same branch always able to form coalitions
-new focus policies about social issues in the sub ideology branches
 (not needed if the major mechanic about policies is made, can just make social stuff there=
-Write descriptions for parties
-events for parties changing name and icon
-Branches for emerging socialist+non aligned communist and lega nord+lega salvini+alleanza nazionale
-Move totalitarian communists to non democratic branch
-Make a military coup path as precursor to current non democratic branch, with option to keep coup in power as nat autocracy

FOCUS TREE
-more love for the territorial expansion branch, especially separate retake levant from retake africa
-custom icons for focuses and ideas (can't do it myself, need a graphic wizard)
-expand the "italian federation" and "dismantle the nation" sub-branches
-make a small tree for the new nations if italy splits (distant future)
-a focus tree branch about the relation with the church
-a focus tree branch about the absolute trainwreck that is Rome and its administration
-develop the fight against tax evasion and anti corruption measures with a slightly more complex mechanic instead of just a single focus
-add more interactions with Internal factions all around
-referendum events for consitutional changes
-make custom game rules for different AI paths

RANDOM STUFF
-more monuments to be restored with integrative restoration decisions
-urban waste management disasters events
