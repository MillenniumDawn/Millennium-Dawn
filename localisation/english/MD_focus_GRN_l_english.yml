  native_inuit_spiritualism_desc:0 "Inuit spiritualistic beliefs are comprised of local folklore and mythologies that have been recited orally by generations of shamans and elders dating back thousands of years. The Inuit believe in a pantheon of deities that preside over the occurences of natural phenomenon and of the environment. There is also the belief that within every living organisms, be it animal, human, supernatual entity, and even plants, resides within them a spirit or 'breath' known as 'Anirniit'.\n\nIt is said that because everything has a spirit, it's considered just as grave of an offense to kill another lifeform without following proper rituals, as it is no different to murdering a fellow human. The 'Anirniit' is considered as an integral part of the surrounding ambience known as 'Sila', and many Inuit pay tribute and gain charactarisics of a certain spirit by taking its name or are further more invoked by those who share a connection to the spirit."
