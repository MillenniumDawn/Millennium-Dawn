 MBT_Equipment_7_desc:0 "The incorporation of natotubes into the composite armor mix improves protection, and enables important weight reductions. Automation of all the Main Battle Tank's systems makes a operator optional, allowing for changed shape-profiles to reduce Radar Cross-Sections, which together with radio-wave absorbient materials and a powerful exhaust cooling system give the tank semi-stealth characteristics. MBT's are heavily armored and highly mobile in flat terrain, and provide armies with powerful direct fire abilities."
