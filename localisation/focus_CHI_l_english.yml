  CHI_Chairman_Jiang_Reign:0 "Chairman Jiang's Reign"
  CHI_Chairman_Jiang_Reign_desc:0 "The successor of the illustrious Deng Xiaoping to the Presidency of China, Jiang Zemin, was a man committed to free-market reforms as well as the political supremacy of the CCP. In the years leading up to the turn of the millennium, Jiang kicked off his term with a number of different policies including a series of privatizations."
  CHI_End_PLA_Business_Ventures:0 "End PLA Business Ventures"
  CHI_End_PLA_Business_Ventures_desc:0 "In order to make up for defence budget cuts under Deng Xiaoping, the country’s military, the PLA, started acquiring business ventures in the 1970s. However the government has recently started to become concerned by this phenomenon due to increasing corruption in the PLA as well as the threat posed by allowing the military to gain control over a significant portion of the country’s economy. A new directive to remove the PLA from most sectors of the economy is therefore necessary, but in order to placate the military we must implement this alongside an increase in the military budget."
  CHI_Future_of_the_CPC:0 "The Future of the CPC"
  CHI_Future_of_the_CPC_desc:0 "As much as the Communist Party of China likes to present itself as a strong, united entity, it is not immune to fissures along factional lines. We must choose which, if any faction we desire to favour."
  CHI_Three_Represents_Thought:0 "Three Represents Thought"
  CHI_Three_Represents_Thought_desc:0 "The “Three Represents” is a theory of what the Communist Party represents as put forward by Jiang Zemin. The theory states that the Communist Party must be representative of advanced social productive forces, advanced culture, and the interests of the majority."
  CHI_Youth_League_Dominance:0 "Communist Youth League Dominance"
  CHI_Youth_League_Dominance_desc:0 "The Chinese Communist Youth League is an influential organization that has groomed a large number of Communist Party officials, including vice-president Hu Jintao. The alumni of the organization tend to be slightly more politically liberal than other party officials, and tend to identify themselves more with the rural lower classes, striving for socioeconomic equality wherever possible. However, they are by no means pro-democracy and are willing to use force to put down insurrection if necessary."
  CHI_Preserve_CPC_Unity:0 "Preserve CPC Unity"
  CHI_Preserve_CPC_Unity_desc:0 "China cannot prosper if either the Communist Youth League or the Shanghai clique wield too much unchallenged influence. We must strive to keep both factions in check."
  CHI_Shanghai_Clique_Dominance:0 "Shanghai Clique Dominance"
  CHI_Shanghai_Clique_Dominance_desc:0 "The Shanghai Clique is a political faction centred around Jiang Zemin, a grouping made up predominantly of pro-business politicians, princelings, and individuals hailing from China’s more wealthy, urban areas. This faction is keen to implement free-market reforms and rapid economic development as quickly as possible."
  CHI_End_Class_Warfare:0 "End Class Warfare"
  CHI_End_Class_Warfare_desc:0 "As a result of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents Thought”, the foundations of Chinese political thought have been substantially, if subtly amended. While Mao’s underlying ideology relied on class warfare in favour of the rural peasants against the urban bourgeoisie, Jiang’s more pro-business orientation has led him to favour an end to this aspect of Chinese governance in favour of an inclusion and acceptance of the Chinese business and entrepreneurial class."
  CHI_Hu_Jintao_Agenda:0 "Hu Jintao's Agenda"
  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Agenda:0 "Zeng Qinghong's Agenda"
  CHI_Peaceful_Rise:0 "China's Peaceful Rise"
  CHI_Peaceful_Rise_desc:0 "The perception of China as a threat to international peace and security is not uncommon in the US and amongst our neighbours. To counter this, we should adopt the official policy of “China’s peaceful rise” or, to put it in an even less threatening way, “China’s peaceful development”. This will assure our Western and regional partners that we do not seek conflict."
  CHI_Scientific_Outlook_on_Development:0 "Scientific Outlook on Development"
  CHI_Scientific_Outlook_on_Development_desc:0 "In many ways a backlash by Hu Jintao against the growth-centric focus of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, the “Scientific Outlook on Development” is the theoretical underpinning of Hu’s government, one that focuses on sustainable growth that minimizes environmental pollution and socioeconomic inequality."
  CHI_Harmonious_Society:0 "Harmonious Society"
  CHI_Harmonious_Society_desc:0 "As part of Hu Jintao’s scientific outlook on development, the Chinese government is under a new directive to establish a “harmonious society” in which social injustice is not left unchecked in the wake of unhindered economic growth."
  CHI_Green_GDP:0 "Green GDP"
  CHI_Green_GDP_desc:0 "A key tenet of the scientific outlook on development is sustainability. As such, we should encourage provincial officials to measure economic growth with a new yardstick, Green GDP. If this policy becomes widespread, this could reduce the level of environmental degradation that is brought about by our rapid economic development."
  CHI_Set_up_Confucius_Institutes:0 "Set up Confucius Institutes"
  CHI_Set_up_Confucius_Institutes_desc:0 "In order to project Chinese soft power abroad, we can establish Confucius Institutes around the world to teach Chinese culture and the Chinese language."
  CHI_Global_Chinese_Culture:0 "Global Chinese Culture"
  CHI_Global_Chinese_Culture_desc:0 " As a further continuation of our policy of conducting diplomacy through soft power, we should make use of our unique culture and history to increase our global influence."
  CHI_Develop_Chinese_Cinema:0 "Develop Chinese Cinema"
  CHI_Develop_Chinese_Cinema_desc:0 " America has Hollywood, India has Bollywood. Even Nigeria has Nollywood. The Chinese film industry has historically had little success beyond China’s borders, failing even to achieve substantial popularity within China itself. Investing in the Chinese film industry can help further our cultural diplomacy by giving a much needed boost to our soft power."
  CHI_8_Honours_8_Shames:0 "8 Honours and 8 Shames"
  CHI_8_Honours_8_Shames_desc:0 "Chinese governments since Mao Zedong have strived to maintain the integrity and character of the Chinese people, ours shall be no different. The 8 honours and 8 shames compels individuals to be loyal to both the Chinese nation and people, diligent, well-informed, united, honest, disciplined and frugal."
  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Agenda:0 "Zeng Qinghong's Agenda"
  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Agenda_desc:0 "The strengthening of the Shanghai Clique has paved the way for Jiang Zemin’s so-called “hatchet man” to assume leadership of the Communist Party and the nation. Zeng will have to overcome his limited popularity in the party relative to figures like Hu Jintao and Wen Jiaobao to push his reformist agenda."
  CHI_Affirm_Ties_to_the_Military:0 "Affirm Ties to the Military"
  CHI_Affirm_Ties_to_the_Military_desc:0 "In order to make changes to the composition of the Communist Party, Zeng Qinghong must make use of his connections to powerful military generals. These ties must be strengthened before any inevitably unpopular reformist agenda is pursued."
  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Thought:0 "Zeng Qinghong Thought"
  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Thought_desc:0 "Building upon Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, Zeng has formulated a new ideological underpinning for the CPC, one that stresses the duty of the party to represent the majority of Chinese people. Zeng Qinghong thought calls for a more accountable and transparent party that can be perceived as more representative and legitimate by the Chinese people. Key to this theory is the idea of the “gaze of the people” and how party officials can only maximize the interests of the country when working under this gaze."
  CHI_Intra_Party_Democracy:0 "Intra-Party Democracy"
  CHI_Intra_Party_Democracy_desc:0 "One of Zeng Qinghong’s key ideas is that of intra-party democracy, in which elections are used to select local-level party secretaries. Now that he has come to power, this idea can be expanded to encompass a range of new reforms to increase transparency and accountability within the communist party."
  CHI_Increase_Local_Autonomy:0 "Increase Local Autonomy"
  CHI_Increase_Local_Autonomy_desc:0 "Part of Zeng Qinghong’s transparency initiative is the construction of a more federal system, one in which officials can be more accountable and feel more connected to the provinces in which they operate."
  CHI_Public_Examinations:0 "Public Examinations"
  CHI_Public_Examinations_desc:0 "In order to fill the Communist Party apparatus with the most competent officials possible, Zeng has ordered that all lower-level posts should be filled through rigorous public examinations rather than by appointment. This policy will require a more substantial party bureaucracy."
  CHI_Succession_Question:0 "The Succession Question"
  CHI_Succession_Question_desc:0 "The question of who should assume leadership of the party is a crucial one. While the princeling vice-president Xi Jinping is widely considered to be the most likely choice to succeed the current president, his fellow princeling Bo Xilai has been a rising star in Chinese politics for several years now and came close to threatening Xi’s ascension to the position of vice-president. While both Xi Jinping’s personality and ideological views seem somewhat muted, Bo Xilai has spent a great deal of time during his governing of Chongqing making a name for himself both as an individual and as an ideologue. The choice of which of the two will ascend to the presidency will determine the future of the nation."
  CHI_Promote_Youth_League_Members:0 "Promote Youth League Members"
  CHI_Promote_Youth_League_Members_desc:0 "We should shore up the position of Hu Jintao's allies, graduates of the Communist Youth League, also known as the Tuanpai or members of the populist coalition."
  CHI_Wang_Lijun_Incident:0 "The Wang Lijun Incident"
  CHI_Wang_Lijun_Incident_desc:0 "Bo Xilai poses too great a threat to our government and our vision for China to be left unopposed. We should use current events to our advantage, and seek to put a stop to Bo's seemingly inexorable rise by any means possible."
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Agenda:0 "Xi Jinping's Agenda"
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Agenda_desc:0 "With Bo Xilai out of the way, the path is clear for a smooth transition of power to vice-president Xi Jinping. A princeling who does not fit squarely within either the Tuanpai/Youth League Faction or the Shanghai Clique, Xi will have to build consensus and achieve compromise within the politically turbulent communist party."
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Thought:0 "Xi Jinping Thought"
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Thought_desc:0 "Xi Jinping's contribution to the theoretical basis of the CPC's rule is one that establishes a large number of lofty goals for the party and the country going forward. What sets this particular theory apart from those of most of Xi's predecessors is the extent to which adherance to this ideology is tied to loyalty. Loyalty to the party, loyalty to the country, but also significantly, loyalty to Xi Jinping himself."
  CHI_China_Dream:0 "The Chinese Dream"
  CHI_China_Dream_desc:0 "A concept frequently alluded to by Xi Jinping, the Chinese Dream encapsulates the goals of the Chinese individual and nation. As such, it includes aspirations in a large variety of areas including the economic, political, and international spheres."
  CHI_Flowing_Spring:0 "Flowing Spring"
  CHI_Flowing_Spring_desc:0 "Taking his Chinese Dream to the next level, Xi Jinping has drawn on a poem from the 8th century BCE entitled "Flowing Spring" which concerns regaining greatness and prosperity. Rather than a more moderated approach to China's future, the concept of the flowing spring calls upon Chinese citizens to regain their lost greatness and achieve the most they possibly can. The Chinese nation, similarly, should seek to match its illustrious history and culture by continually striving for improvement."
  CHI_Xiaokang_Society:0 "Xiaokang Society"
  CHI_Xiaokang_Society_desc:0 "The idea of a moderately prosperous society is not a new one in Chinese politics. Nonethless, Xi Jinping has decided to give this concept a new lease of life, calling upon the nation to strive for a country that is equally and only moderately well-off."

  CHI_Purge_Tuanpai_desc:0 "The Youth League faction, or Tuanpai, has gotten too ambitious and must be cut down to size. It is high time that we purge these so-called populists and replace them with those who better suit our aspirations for China's future."
  CHI_Promote_Princelings:0 "Promote Princelings"
  CHI_Promote_Princelings_desc:0 "While the venerable members of Jiang Zemin's Shanghai clique have served China well, it is time for them to retire and make way for a new generation of leaders. The princelings, children of China's original revolutionaries, should take the place of both the Tuanpai and the Shanghai clique."
  CHI_Bo_Xilai_Agenda:0 "Bo Xilai's Agenda"
  CHI_Bo_Xilai_Agenda_desc:0 "Following the rise to power of the princelings and the political chaos that followed the purge of the Youth League faction, Bo Xilai has managed to come out on top by distinguishing himself from his fellow princelings with his ardent "New Left" ideology. Bo will now be free to pursue his somewhat controversial vision for Chinese politics."
