 britain.2.t:2 "The Future of the NHS"
 britain.2.d:2 "The National Health Service is the public healthcare program of the United Kingdom and its future in government budgets is always hotly contested between the political parties. We should probably come to a decision what direction the government should take in this vital issue."
 britain.2.o1:2 "One for all, all for one!"
 britain.2.o2:2 "Hands off my healthcare!"
 britain.3.t:2 "Britain demands Special Treatment"
 britain.3.d:2 "The British delegation to the European Parliament has been walking around Brussels like a bunch of puppeteers playing with their puppets recently. They are thwarting every move by the union and blocking most of our progress. This is becoming unbearable."
 britain.3.o1:2 "Are you serious?"
 britain.4.t:2 "The Brexit Referendum"
 britain.4.d:2 "\"Brexit\", short for British Exit, is the weird term given by the British and international press to the concept of Britain leaving the European Union.\n\nNow, this concept is to come to fruition: The British citizens are to vote on their future in the Union: Leave? Or Stay?"
 britain.4.o1:2 "Let the voting begin."
 britain.5.t:2 "The monarchy abolished!"
 britain.5.d:2 "Sensing the change in time, the British monarch has today undertaken steps to revoke their claims on the throne. In the meantime, government officials are making sure that the founding documents of our country are rewritten in a way as to no monarch being necessary to represent it.\nThis is the end of the British monarchy."
 britain.5.o1:2 "Good riddance."
 britain.6.t:2 "Queen Elizabeth II abdicates!"
 britain.6.d1:2 "\"I never asked for this. I never thought that Britain would return onto a dark path of unelightened tyranny. I am too old, too frail and frankly unwilling to run a country. If Britain truly chooses to give powers back to the monarchy, they will have to find another candidate.\"\n\nIn a political shock, Queen Elizabeth II has abdicated. Even though the preparations for the coronations of her son Charles, soon to be Charles III of the United Kingdom, are being, the British people cannot stop themselves from looking at themselves and questioning if that path is truly the right one."
 britain.6.d2:2 "\"This is absolutely unacceptable. I myself have fought against Hitler's war machine in the British Armed Forces, and now the British government with the backing of the British people is returning to proto-fascistic tendencies. I will not and cannot stand for this.\"\n\nIn a political earthquake, Queen Elizabeth II abdicated in protest of the recent government choices. Her son, soon to be King Charles III, is preparing to be coronated."
 britain.6.o1:2 "Long live the King!"
 britain.7.t:2 "Britain supports NATO!"

 britain.8.t:2 "British Trade Investments"
 britain.8.d:2 "A British Trade Delegation has arrived in our capital. This will only increase our economic ties to the United Kingdom."

 britain.9.t:2 "National Development"
 britain.9.d:2 "A new National Development project has begun. There are several projects in the works right now and one of them certainly will come to fruition."
 britain.9.o1:2 "Let's see where this goes."
 britain.10.t:2 "Britain attacks Capitalism"
 britain.10.d:2 "The British government, in economic and diplomatic ties to us, has recently declared its intention to utterly destroy intercontinental capitalism. This will surely put a strain on our relations."
 britain.10.o1:2 "These fools."
 britain.10.o2:2 "Maybe their way is the right one?"
 britain.11.t:2 "The Britain-EU border agreement"
 britain.11.d:2 "The idea of a comprehensive revision of our current agreement with the Schengen zone has been tossed around in Parliament for quite some time. We have to choose our next step carefully."

 britain.11.o2:2 "A more open policy is the way."
 britain.12.t:2 "The CANZUK Alliance"

 britain.12.o2:2 "We have our own problems."
 britain.13.t:2 "Britain requests workforce border deal"
 britain.13.d:2 "The British government has approached us over a possible border arrangement that allows Irish citizens to pass into Northern Ireland easier in order to improve both the local Irish standard of living the Northern Irish economy. This possible arrangement is popular with the Irish population - as it offers employment to the struggling economy."
 britain.13.o1:2 "Sounds fine."
 britain.13.o2:2 "We would rather not."
 britain.14.t:2 "Air Travel Agreement with Europe"
 britain.14.d:2 "We have finalized the outlines of a relatively free future air travel between the UK and the EU. Personal and goods transport by aircraft has been made more straightforward as a process. Both the European and British public are in favor of decreasing the unnecessary cost caused by the current arrangements."
 britain.14.o1:2 "Good."
 britain.15.t:2 "British Alliance invites us"
 britain.15.d:2 "The British government has requested that we join their alliance. This would mean abandoning our own, if applicable, and given up possible leadership claims."
 britain.15.o1:2 "Sure!"
 britain.15.o2:2 "Heck no."
 britain.16.t:2 "European Military Cooperation Program"
 britain.16.d:2 "The British government has launched the EMCP, the European Military Cooperation Program. The British armed forces have made defending their allies' territory a priority in order to defend their own."
 britain.16.o1:2 "We appreciate the help."
 britain.17.t:2 "Reorganize the Education System"
 britain.17.d:2 "With a far more national government course, we need to also restructure our future education program: Should we exclude pupils of ethnic minorities, catering to the fascists, or should we simply remove any quotas based on race and sex and emphasize merit?"
 britain.17.o1:2 "Based on merit."
 britain.17.o2:2 "Based on ethnic background."
 britain.17.o3:2 "A hybrid system sounds fine."
 britain.18.t:2 "Revolutionary Committee in Britain"
 britain.18.d:2 "The British government has revealed its newest government agency: A revolutionary committee, focusing on driving ahead the red workers' revolution into other countries. Our economic ties to Britain are bound to suffer."
 britain.18.o1:2 "Fools!"
 britain.19.t:2 "The Quebec Revolt"
 britain.19.d:2 "We have been in contact with the Franco Canadian population of Quebec. The support for independence is now overwhelming and a militant force is prepared to take up arms. At the same time, we have also sowed dissent among Canadian east coast populations.\n\nOur demands to Canada will be simple: Let Quebec be free and retreat from its anglo Canadian atlantic provinces."
 britain.19.o1:2 "Send the demands!"
 britain.20.t:2 "Britain attacks Canada!"
 britain.20.d:2 "\"We have two simple demands to the government of Canada:\n1: Immediately grant independence to the Canadian province of Quebec as an independent and sovereign nation, including the grand cities of Quebec City and Montreal.\n2: Cede the Canadian provinces New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador to the British government.\nShould the Canadian government resist, war is inevitable.\n\nsigned, the [ENG.GetAdjective] government\nsigned, the Quebecois government-in-exile in London\"\n\nWhat do we do now?!"
 britain.20.o1:2 "We will bow to their demands. This time."

 britain.21.o1:2 "Good."
 britain.22.t:2 "'Leave'!"
 britain.22.d:2 "The results are in, and with an edge of about 4%, the 'Leave' campaign won. Britain will have to prepare to leave the European Union."
 britain.22.o1:2 "Alright then."
 britain.23.t:2 "'Remain'!"
 britain.23.d:2 "The referendum is done and the results have been counted. At about 53% to 47%, the 'Remain' campaign won. 'Leave' campaigners Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson have already announced their willingness to accept the results - Britain stays!"
 britain.23.o1:2 "Indeed we do."
 britain.24.t:2 "Ireland accepts!"
 britain.24.d:2 "The Irish government has gladly accepted our proposal. The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is opening up already."
 britain.24.o1:2 "Excellent!"
 britain.25.t:2 "Queen Elizabeth II dies"
 britain.25.d:2 "Elizabeth Alexandra Mary, daughter of George VI, has peacefully passed in her sleep. She was nearly 100 years old and had been queen for nearly 70.\n\nThe nation and the commonwealth at large are in mourning. The long reign of the queen oversaw the end of the Empire, the revitalization of the Home Islands, the entry into the European Union and a proud and strong start into the dawning 3rd millennium.\n\nThe queen was a living legend. But every legend eventually dies."
 britain.25.o1:2 "She will reign in heaven now."
 britain.26.t:2 "King Charles III dies"
 britain.26.d:2 "'Charles is dead', a newspaper titles, followed by the subheading 'Only few are mourning'.\n\nKing Charles III was historically unpopular, comparable to the likes of his grand uncle Edward VIII.\n\nHis son, William V, will surely be a more popular king for the British people."
 britain.26.o1:2 "No king rules forever."

 european_union.10.t:0 "Abandoning the EU"
 european_union.10.d1:0 "The European Union is just a weak alliance of cuckolds, race traitors and filthy liberals. The officials in Brussels have now asked our delegation to leave their so-called 'holy halls' after one of our delegates requested a picture of Adolf Hitler to be hung up behind the speaker's podium. This probably is the beginning of the end of our EU membership - which is likely for the best, as that saves us the paperwork to quit by ourselves.\n\nThey can watch their wives get raped by foreigners all they want, but they will have to do it without us. These bastards."
 european_union.10.d2:0 "The European Union holds us and our fellow sovereign European states back from greatness. The members of our government grow increasingly upset with the European attitude towards our national sovereignity and the ease with which European delegates do whatever the United States tells them to do.\n\nWe need to quit. This is unacceptable. They can kiss American asses all they want, but they will have to do that without us."
 european_union.10.d3:0 "While monarchies are not technically banned from joining the European Union, they have to have petty little things like parliaments or elections - which the grand system around [This.GetLeader] thankfully is devoid of. This however has lead to a precarious spot for us, being asked to either hold general elections within the next week or be expelled from the halls.\n\nWell, we won't hold elections, that much is certain, so it seems they will have to play their little 'democracy' game without us."
 european_union.10.d4:0 "With a right-wing political party now in power, the democratic character and economic benefit of the European Union has been increasingly called into question.\n\nThe [This.GetRulingParty] delegates are split on the issue: The ideological hardliners want to leave the union no matter the consequences, while the economically liberal faction points to the number of jobs created by the EU and the political stability it brings to the continent.\n\nAny decision will be controversial, as the populous is split on the issue. Will the EU carry on without us - or should we stay?"
 european_union.10.d5:0 "The European Union is nothing but a bunch of capitalists that try to conquer the world for capitalism. Our brave [This.GetAdjective] delegates have stood up for the working people in every session they attended, but they are outvoted on almost any issue - when asking to disown the super rich across Europe, the delegation was even kicked from the hall! Well, maybe they should not have attacked three other delegations while their speaker was trying to argue with them, but still!\n\nThis is completely unacceptable. We can no longer carry this farce of a conglomerate. Without us!"
 european_union.10.d6:0 "Even [This.GetLeader] has remarked that the European Union is really 'nothing but a bunch of infidels' when talking to a conservative islamic newspaper last week. Because of this, calls to leave the EU have gotten louder the country over - and inside the European Union. 'If you don't respect our holy halls, leave!', the president of the European Parliament shouted at our delegation today. After one of our delegates remarked that there is nothing holy except for Allah, he was kicked from the hall.\n\nThe EU has run its course for our nation. We are thankful for their cooperation, but their hedonism and worldly intrigue is unacceptable. They will have to play their stupid games without us."
