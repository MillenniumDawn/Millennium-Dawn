 KOR_the_rok_armed_forces: "The ROK Armed Forces"
 KOR_the_rok_armed_forces_desc: "The Republic of Korea's existence is defined by its constant vulnerability. Clashes with the North are constant reminders of the threat that the DPRK poses to our citizens' security. Beyond the peninsula, we must remain vigilant against new and old enemies that would wish to do us harm. To guard against all such threats, our armed forces must be as strong as they possibly can be."

 KOR_p8_poseidon: "The P-8 Poseidon"
 KOR_p8_poseidon_desc: "It is time for our aging fleet of P-3Cs to be retired. These maritime patrol aircraft have only detected 28% of North Korean submarines involved in exercises, and therefore need to be replaced with newer models. The Boeing P-8 Poseidon was developed by the US to replace its own P-3Cs. It may be wise for us to follow the example of our strongest ally."

 KOR_c295_desc: "It is time for our aging fleet of P-3Cs to be retired.

The Spanish C-296 MPA is a significantly more affordable option than the P-8, but is generally considered an inferior aircraft."
