 BOT_model_student_of_africa: "Model Student of Africa"
 BOT_model_student_of_africa_desc: "Botswana is one of the highly developed countries in Africa. Ever since its independence, it has been a stable democracy and and has seen very little conflict. Boasting the highest human development index and the lowest perceived corruption in sub-Saharan Africa, Botswana is a shining light for the rest of Africa to follow.\n\n§RIf our §YCorruption Level§! is higher than §Y$widespread_corruption$§! we will lose this bonus!§!"
 BOT_kalahari_expansion: "Kalahari Desertification"
 BOT_kalahari_expansion_desc: "The Kalahari Desert in the Western part of Botswana covers a large area. Year after year, this desert expands more. As 95% of Botswana receives so little rainfall that it is not viable for agriculture, 71% of the country is being used for agricultural grazing and most people get their water from groundwater. The large cattle industry makes the desertification worse, though almost half of Botswanans get their income from it.\n\nWestern Botswana is also a home to many national parks (which make up 20% of the country's land area), the largest of which is the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, home to the San People and one of the largest diamond mines in Botswana.\n\n§YEvery year we will get an update on the desertification status of the Kalahari. The most likely option for it is to increase every year.\n\nWe can continue exploiting the already suffering Kalahari and the surroung Savannah and make the desertification worse, or we can try to take a conservationist approach to slow down or even reverse it.§!"
 BOT_house_of_chiefs: "House of Chiefs"
 BOT_house_of_chiefs_desc: "The House of Chiefs (Ntlo ya Dikgosi) is an advisory body of the Botswanan parliament. The House composes of the hereditary chiefs of Botswana's 8 principle tribes, 22 elected members and 5 chiefs nominated by the President. The House holds no political or executive power, however most bills and all constitutional changes have to be reviewed and discussed in the House before making to the National Assembly. The Dikgosi themselves hold only ceremonial and small administrative power over their tribes."
 BOT_house_of_chiefs_tt: "Cost to Change Government Expenditures and Policies: §R+15%§!"
 BOT_ancestral_land_conflict: "Ancestral Land Conflict"
 BOT_ancestral_land_conflict_desc: "In the Central Kalahari Game Reserve live the hunter-gatherer San People (also known as Bushmen), one of the oldest cultures on Earth. There also live other first nations people there such as the Bakgalagadi (after whom the desert is named). The Game Reserve was originally created to protect both the wildlife and the way of life of the Bushmen.\n\nIn the 1970s, the government of Botswana claimed that the San were overhunting the animals, and the area being a nature reserve blocked the government from setting up services for the San (such as schools and hospitals). A relocation program started, which happened to coincide with a diamond vein found in the Game Reserve. In the 1990s, relocation efforts intensified as the Government started cutting access to services for the people living in the reserve.\n\nThe San People only make up a tiny fraction of our population, and as such have no real ways of opposing us. However, their treatment is a stain on our international image."
 BOT_BDP_stronghold: "£BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP Stronghold"
 BOT_BDP_stronghold_desc: "Ever since the creation of the country, the £BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP (Botswana Democratic Party) has been ruling the country. Election after election they have been the largest party, with their smallest vote share being 55%. They are a big tent party that mixes conservatism, liberalism and socialism. Their main power comes from their Setswana supporters, so many other tribes in the country end up feeling left out. It would take a big political scandal to break the BDP hold on power.\n\n§YAs long as the A-Team and Barata-Phati factions of the £BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP combined form the largest party, the £BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP will stay in power after elections.\n\nIf the £BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP becomes too strong, opposition parties will form into a single party, and any effects that would impact a single minor party will affect this new party.\n\nIf the £BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP popularity drops too low, the reformist wing of the party will form its own party.§!"
 BOT_zimbabwean_refugees: "Zimbabwean Refugees"
 BOT_zimbabwean_refugees_desc: "The economic situation in Zimbabwe is pushing thousands of people both legally and illegally across the border into Botswana. Approximately one third of the Zimbabweans are in the country illegally, and most people crossing the border are immediately deported back to Zimbabwe. However, the mass number of refugees does have its benefits; while most Botswanans get their living from cattle, most Zimbabweans work in the mining and industrial sectors, making them a disproportionate part of the Botswanan skilled labour force."
 BOT_army_of_peacekeepers: "Peacekeeping Army"
 BOT_army_of_peacekeepers_desc: "The Botswanan Defence Forces have reformed their army to serve as a peacekeeping force across the globe. Of course, people aren't that excited that the only reason they join the army is to die in another country"

 Botswana_pulse.1.t: "Kalahari Desert Expands"
 Botswana_pulse.1.d: "According last year's data, the Kalahari Desert has continued expanding. Several areas meant for grazing are now barren, multiple groundwater sources have dried up and wildlife has been cut down due to poaching. Allowing people to freely graze their cattle where they want, mineral exploitation of the region and ignoring poaching is bound to make the situation worse."
 Botswana_pulse.1.a: "Shame"
 Botswana_pulse.2.t: "Kalahari Desert Normal"
 Botswana_pulse.2.d: "According last year's data, the desertification situation in and around the Kalahari seems to be holding steady. It is however only a matter of time before it gets worse again. Allowing people to freely graze their cattle where they want, mineral exploitation of the region and ignoring poaching is bound to make the situation worse."
 Botswana_pulse.2.a: "We have been given more time"
 Botswana_pulse.3.t: "Kalahari Desert Retreats"
 Botswana_pulse.3.d: "According last year's data, vegetation has grown part into large areas of the Kalahari. Mimicking natural grazing patterns and combating poaching will allow the area to heal itself."
 Botswana_pulse.3.a: "We have made progress"

 BOT_enlist_women_desc: "While Botswana is a very progressive and modern country, the Army does not accept women as recruits. This is something that should be fixed, and access to the military has been campaigned for the past 20 years by women's rights activist Ntombi Setshwaelo. It is time to allow Setswana women to serve the country"
