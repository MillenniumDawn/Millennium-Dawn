 FSA_death_over_humiliation_desc: "The Free Syrian Army emerging from a group of military defectors known as the Free Officers Movement. These officers refused to follow orders to suppress civilian unrest, choosing instead to take up arms against the government they once served. Their decision marked the beginning of a wider armed opposition movement. Even in the face of overwhelming odds and often lacking centralized command or consistent supplies, the movement remains driven by the belief that freedom is worth more than life under tyranny."
 FSA_extremism1: "Low Radical Influence"
 FSA_extremism1_desc: "While the Free Syrian Army was originally formed by defected officers advocating for a democratic and secular alternative to the regime, the prolonged conflict and decentralized nature of the opposition have allowed more radical factions to gain ground. Islamist-leaning groups such as Ahrar al-Sham, Al-Nusra Front have increasingly operated alongside or within FSA-branded coalitions. These groups have blurred the lines between moderate and extremist elements as these groups use the broader FSA label to gain legitimacy and resources."

 FSA_internal_revolt_category: "Wolves in Sheep's Clothing"
 FSA_internal_revolt_category_desc: "As the conflict drags on the Free Syrian Army has become a patchwork of brigades with differing goals, loyalties, and ideologies. Islamist factions and other Salafi-aligned movements have embedded themselves within the broader FSA structure. While they offer experienced fighters and hold key territory, their long-term ambitions pose a direct threat to any attempt at building a democratic or pluralistic post-conflict Syria."
