 #Land Doctrines
 TITLE_LEGACY_DOCTRINES:0 "Legacy Doctrines"
 LEGACY_DOCTRINES_TITLE:0 "Legacy Doctrines are cold-war era doctrines which still have a noticeable influence on modern military thought."
 legacy_doctrines:0 "Legacy Doctrines"
 legacy_doctrines_desc:0 "Legacy Doctrines are cold-war era doctrines which still have a noticeable influence on modern military thought. Though doctrines change over time, the past is still deeply embeded in any armed force."
 modern_blitzkrieg:0 "Modern Blitzkrieg"
 modern_blitzkrieg_desc:0 "Incredibly successful in the opening stages of World War 2, the German Blitzkrieg doctrine was widely copied by others, and became a mainstay of Cold War strategic thought, especially in NATO-circles. It aims to consentrate mobile forces, using them to continuously manuever into enemy territory, avoiding enemy strong points."
 forward_defense:0 "Forward Defense"
 forward_defense_desc:0 "NATO strategists, in countering the threath of Soviet Mobile Armored Warfare overrunning Western Europe, came up with the doctrine of Forward Defense, where pre-planned defensive forces armed with anti-tank and anti-air weapons would starve off the initial push while reserves where being mobilized behind them. The idea was that the first, initial, titanic-sized battles would determine the outcome of the war, thus the majority of active forces should be placed as close to the border as possible."
 encourage_nco_iniative:0 "Encourage NCO Initiative"
 encourage_nco_iniative_desc:0 "Western Military thought encouraged initiative among Non-Commissioned Officers, (lower-level command) viewing them as the backbone of the Army. As combat changes the situation on the ground rapidly, avoiding to having to go through the entire chain of command allows one to exploit temporary opportunities on the battlefield that would otherwise be missed."
 air_land_battle:0 "AirLand Battle"
 air_land_battle_desc:0 "AirLand Battle emphasized close coordination between land forces acting as an aggressively maneuvering defense, and air forces attacking rear-echelon forces feeding those front line enemy forces, taking pressure off the enemy main advance. The aim is to delay the enemy, creating a window of opportunity to defeat the frontline forces while delivering severe attrition to their rear."
 grand_battleplan:0 "Grand Battleplan"
 grand_battleplan_desc:0 "The Grand Battleplan doctrine favors pre-planning of each stage of combat extensively, holding the view that the side with the best planning would prevail. When done correctly, it can be very powerful, as troops can concentrate on perfecting their aspect of the plan, while allowing combined operations in forces incapable of real-time coordination. Furthermore, good planning avoids logistical problems. However, all this planning is slow work, and it disallows initiative and has no real flexibility in the face of a fluid frontline."
 rigid_hierarchy:0 "Rigid Hierarchy"
 rigid_hierarchy_desc:0 "With the legitimate fear that ones own army poses the greatest threat to regime survival, commanding positions would often be done out of political loyality instead of competance. Large, live-fire excersises would generally not be held. Furthermore, desicionmaking would be centralized, making it slow and unflexible in the face of evolving threats."
 praetorian_guard:0 "Praetorian Guard"
 praetorian_guard_desc:0 "With the political leadership focusing the army on regime protection, elite seperate units were set up that employed professional soldiers with ideological selection and training. These would recieve the best weapons and training, making them well-placed to defend the political leadership from uprisings and the threat of coups by the normal conscripted army."
 armoured_mass_assault:0 "Mass Armoured Assault"
 armoured_mass_assault_desc:0 "Mass Armoured Assault, the Soviet Concept of "Deep Battle" stressed combined arms cooperation, offensive action, and heavily armored shock units. Multiple attacks would be made on a single front by slower, firepower-heavy units in order to break the enemy tactical zone. At the same time, highly mobile armored and mechanized forces would be held in reserve, advancing into the front once gaps are created. This is distinct from the Blitzkreig, which focuses on single weak-points instead of multiple points of contact."
 deep_echelon_advance:0 "Deep Echelon Advance"
 deep_echelon_advance_desc:0 "With gaps in enemy lines sucessfully created, several deep echelon advances of heavily armored shock troops would ravage the enemy rear at an as high speed as possible while avoiding strong points of enemy resistance - leaving them to follow-up advances of less heavy infantry forces. The goal is sieze enemy territory at an breakneck speed, creating the conditions whereby the enemy loses the will to mount an operational defence."
 army_group_operational_freedom:0 "Army Group Operational Freedom"
 army_group_operational_freedom_desc:0 "While rigid in tactical disposition, the Soviet doctrine allowed significant operational freedom to army group formations, enabling ground commanders to make quick desicions. This freedom was larger than among NATO-forces at the time, but did not extend down to lower officers and commanders."
 massed_artillery:0 "Massed Artillery"
 massed_artillery_desc:0 "Using large amounts of both regular artillery and rocket artillery concentrated at the frontline enemy, the hope was to break and disrupt their normal functions. Using artillery in such numbers also reduces the need for fire-support from the air. The sheer numbers led many to call both the Russian and Soviet Armies as an "artillery army with tanks"."
 infiltration_assault:0 "Infiltration Assault"
 infiltration_assault_desc:0 "The Infiltration Assault doctrine uses night-time infiltration behind enemy strong-points to allow suprise assults at normally well-defended positions to succeed by cutting them off from reinforcements."
 defence_in_depth:0 "Defence In Depth"
 defence_in_depth_desc:0 "Defence in depth, often also called "elastic defence", is all about delaying instead of denying outright the advance of the enemy. Supply depots and pre-made fortifications should be placed far from the front, as should the majority of forces. By buying time and causing additional enemy casualties by yielding space, the enemy momentum will wear down from attrition, allowing us to defeat them."
 armoured_counterpunch:0 "Armoured Counterpunch"
 armoured_counterpunch_desc:0 "Building upon defence in depth, this strategy is about deploying significant armored forces at advantageous times in order to cut off enemy deep echelon advances, archiving an decisive victory. However, such concentrations are volunerable to enemy airpower."
 frontline_defence:0 "Frontline Defence"
 frontline_defence_desc:0 "Massing the majority of pre-planned defensive forces as close to the border as possible yields us the largest chance of hanging on to territory, which is essential if we have limited room to retreat due to population centers being close to the front."
 early_tunnel_warfare:0 "Early Tunnel Warfare"
 early_tunnel_warfare_desc:0 "Building extensive networks of underground tunnels allows covert re-supply, shifting of forces and better defences through ambush opportunities. It allows our forces to rest without being subject to air attacks."
 guerilla_specialisation:0 "Guerilla Specialisation"
 guerilla_specialisation_desc:0 "Guerilla warfare seeks to disrupt the military superiority of the opponent by denying them direct combat except in the few areas where parity can be archived through terrain advantages or ambushes. Subjecting the enemy to constant attrition through attacks on softer targets, such as supply convoys."
 21st_Century_Re_Evaluation:0 "21st Century Re-Evaluation"
 21st_Century_Re_Evaluation_desc:0 "The end of the Cold War gave militaries worldwide the nessesary breathing-room to select new doctrines for the future."
 TITLE_NETWORK:0 "Network-Centric Warfare"
 Network_Centric_Warfare:0 "Network-Centric Warfare"
 Network_Centric_Warfare_desc:0 "Network-Centric Warfare was pioneered by the US in the '90s, and is based on introducing command and control and intelligent sensors at increasingly lower levels of the armed forces. This will enable enhanced situational awareness for desicionmakers and combat forces alike, rapid target assessment using supercomputers, lowering the time of making military plans."
 TITLE_DECENTRALIZED:0 "Decentralized Warfare"
 Decentralized_Warfare:0 "Decentralized Warfare"
 Decentralized_Warfare_desc:0 "Decentralized, assymetric warfare have been pioneered by Iran and Russia. It assumes conflict against an networked, technological superior opponent that can cripple the command and control structure. The answer has been to reform into smaller military units with independent desicionmaking powers and command structures so they can remain combat effective. It also places great importance on warfare by alternative means and strong coordination with local stakeholders to archive an local information edge."
 TITLE_GUERILLA:0 "Guerilla Warfare"
 Guerilla_Warfare:0 "Guerilla Warfare"
 Guerilla_Warfare_desc:0 "Widely in usage by non-state actors, guerilla warfare seeks to disrupt the military superiority of the opponent by denying them direct combat except in the few areas where parity can be archived through terrain advantages or ambushes. Fighting towards an political end-goal, non-military means such as psychological warfare is employed to wear down the opponent stability and will to fight. Ironically, through spreading chaos, we can build support for ourselves as the only stable alternative for society."
 Civilian_Infiltration:0 "Civilian Infiltration"
 Civilian_Infiltration_desc:0 "The core of any successful insurgency is to blend in with the general population, both as protection and a grounds for recruitment, so that any targeted surgical action against the insurgency is impossible."
 Drug_Manufacture:0 "Drug Manufacture"
 Drug_Manufacture_desc:0 "Any insurgency needs funding, and by controlling the manufacture and distribution of illicit drugs a lot of income can be gained."
 Ideological_Purity:0 "Ideological Purity"
 Ideological_Purity_desc:0 "By rejecting the possible revenue from drugs, a moral superiority can be archived against the opponent. The organization will also be protected from it's goals being co-opted by greed, archiving a the ideological purity nessesary to prevail."
 Social_Services:0 "Social Services"
 Social_Services_desc:0 "Exploiting the lack of state-provided services or our own disruption of them - Social Services can be used to bind the population's loyalty towards us."
 Human_Shield:0 "Human Shield"
 Human_Shield_desc:0 "Having the loyality of locals, we can protect ourselves from massive bombing from the opponent by basing ourselves in the close proximity of civilians. And if they bomb anyway, the civilian casualities can be employed as propaganda to demoralize the opponent."
 Youth_Indoctination:0 "Youth Indoctination"
 Youth_Indoctination_desc:0 "Taking control over education, we can establish ideological indoctrination of the youth to give us future soldiers willing to sacrifice everything for the cause."
 Hit_and_Run_Tactics:0 "Hit & Run Tactics"
 Hit_and_Run_Tactics_desc:0 "Offensive hit & run tactics seeks to force the opponent to disperse their forces geographically, making them easier targets for us. At the same time, sucessful operations will enhance our image while minimizing losses."
 Prison_Raids:0 "Prison Raids"
 Prison_Raids_desc:0 "By attacking prisons and releasing the prisoners, we gain a fertile ground of recruitment as these prisoners will have both gratitude towards us, and are likely to take up arms for our cause since they are unable to live a normal life."
 Urban_Focus:0 "Urban Focus"
 Urban_Focus_desc:0 "By choosing to specialize in Urban operations, we make the battlefield operations very messy for our opponent."
 3D_Swarming:0 "3D Swarming"
 3D_Swarming_desc:0 "Using the urban cityscape to our advantage, we will move through multi-level buildings and approach the enemy from both above, beneath, and multiple directions to concentrate lethal force in order to break the enemy in that sector."
 No_Surrender:0 "No Surrender"
 No_Surrender_desc:0 "By basing ourselves in Urban terrain, we become volunerable to enemy encirclement. However, with no obvious way out, our forces gain the willpower to fight until death."
 Rural_Focus:0 "Rural Focus"
 Rural_Focus_desc:0 "By choosing to specialize in Rural operations, we gain strength in the hinterlands where the opponent is weakest. We gain mobility and can afford to retreat if it is advantageus for us."
 Tactical_Retreats:0 "Tactical Retreats"
 Tactical_Retreats_desc:0 "By tactical retreating at an advantageus time, we preserve our forces while strengthening other areas. As the enemy cannot afford to protect all retaken areas suficciently, we can always return to most of them later. By denying the enemy any desicive victory, we will wear out their morale."
 Covert_Relocation:0 "Covert Relocation"
 Covert_Relocation_desc:0 "By having the strategic deept to move around forces, and not caring about our own territorial integrity, we can covertly relocate forces to where the enemy is weak - gaining decisive advantages."
 Autonomus_Combat_Cells:0 "Autonomus Combat Cells"
 Autonomus_Combat_Cells_desc:0 "Decentralizing the command structure so that very small groups can operate independently, and at the same time making sure that no single person or group can identify several other groups, we disrupt the enemy intel gathering efforts."
 Tunnel_Warfare:0 "Tunnel Warfare"
 Tunnel_Warfare_desc:0 "Building extensive networks of underground tunnels allows covert re-supply, shifting of forces and better defences through ambush opportunities. As the enemy cannot use airpower or armored units inside tunnels, the disparity of forces are equalized."
 Rhizome_Manoeuver:0 "Rhizome Manoeuver"
 Rhizome_Manoeuver_desc:0 "An tactic for urban areas, the Rhizome Manoeuver is essentially "walking through walls", treating the Urban enviroment not as a grid of streets, but a flexible, almost liquid medium, forever-in-flux, aiming to allow unobserved movement, and unexpected attacks. It can further be enchanced by the unprecedented mobility of having special units trained in free-running/Parkour."
 Light_Infantry_Focus:0 "Light Infantry Focus"
 Light_Infantry_Focus_desc:0 "Focusing on Light Infantry to deliver amushes and attacks allows us to scale up the insurgency and be more proficient at the conventional warfare nessesary to take full control over an territory."
 IED_and_Mine_Focus:0 "IED & Mine Focus"
 IED_and_Mine_Focus_desc:0 "Specializing in using Improvised Explosive Devicies (IED) and land mines, we force the opponent to move very slowly in any offensive against us, making them predictible and easier to avoid. The Psychological impact of constant attrition from IED's against convoys can also demoralize the enemy. This approach allows us to deliver casualities to the enemy without sustaining them ourselves."
 Cult_of_Martyrs:0 "Cult of Martyrs"
 Cult_of_Martyrs_desc:0 "Celebrating the sacrifice of lives for an cause turns it into an religious dimension, which is an powerful propaganda tool to recruit others to our cause."
 Suicide_Bombings:0 "Suicide Bombings"
