 PER_route_secure.1: "[PER.GetName] seeks out a route"
 PER_route_secure.1.t: "[PER.GetName] seeks out a route"
 PER_route_secure.1.d: "[PER.GetName] has expressed an interest in securing a route to obtain nuclear material from Korea. Their delegates have come to us, requesting to use the port city of Kandla as a resupplying base before reaching Chabahar. This route has been used before during the Afghan War by the United States, and [PER.GetName] is offering to negociate payment. Should we grant them the assistance that they desire?"
 PER_route_secure.1.a: "Yes, for a price, that is..."
 PER_route_secure.1.b: "No, [PER.GetName] must be contained!"
 
 PER_route_secure.2: "[RAJ.GetName] Accepts!"
 PER_route_secure.2.t: "[RAJ.GetName] Accepts!"
 PER_route_secure.2.d: "[RAJ.GetName] has accepted to negociate with us over the terms of using Kandla for the transport of nuclear materials. However, they request a significant amount of money if we are to use such an important commercial port for such purposes. Therefore, our Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance proposed a hefty sum of 10 billion to ensure that the Indians say yes. However, some within the Ministry argue that the treasury is unable to handle such a quick drop in capital, and that the project should be dropped altogether..."
 PER_route_secure.2.a: "Send the delegation, Offer 10 Billion!"
 PER_route_secure.2.b: "Perhaps we should reconsider..."
 
 PER_route_secure.3: "[RAJ.GetName] Declines!"
 PER_route_secure.3.t: "[RAJ.GetName] Declines!"
 PER_route_secure.3.d: "[RAJ.GetName] has declined to negociate with us over the terms of using Kandla, citing that the risk of nuclear material leaking into the harbour was too great. However, if we offer a higher sum than initially thought of, we could cover the cost of extra care with the material to prevent leakage, and, if it comes to pass, the cost of cleanup. Our Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance drafted up a report on the additional cost, with the resulting increase being an extra 10 billion minimum to assuage fears of lackluster care. However, some within the Ministry argue that the treasury is unable to handle such a quick drop in capital, and that the project should be dropped altogether..."
 PER_route_secure.3.a: "Renegociate, we need [RAJ.GetName]'s assistance!"
 PER_route_secure.3.b: "The cost of this endeavor is not worth it..."
 
 PER_route_secure.4: "[PER.GetName] requests Renegociations!"
 PER_route_secure.4.t: "[PER.GetName] requests Renegociations!"
 PER_route_secure.4.d: "Despite our initial declination, the Iranians have returned with an offer of 10 billion, plus an additional 10 billion to ensure no leakage or lack of care due to cutting corners. With this assurance, the Deendayal Port Authority, along with the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways have vocalized their support for the idea, citing that the excess could be used in the development of the Kandla port via the addition of four multipurpose cargo berths, as it is the largest port by volume, and the addition of said four berths is planned to increase the current cargo capacity of the port by 8 million tonnes. Both the authority and the ministry have made formal requests to the Prime Minister to accept the deal, citing the need to decongest the port."
 PER_route_secure.4.a: "Very well then, I suppose we could give them another chance..."
 PER_route_secure.4.b: "No means no, we cannot risk the lives of our citizens over potential prospects!"
 
 PER_route_secure.5: "[PER.GetName]'s Offer!"
 PER_route_secure.5.t: "[PER.GetName]'s Offer!"
 PER_route_secure.5.d: "The Iranians have come back, offering 10 billion for the development of the Chabahar and Kandla ports to prepare both with the necessary facilities to house nuclear materials. Our government is split on whether to take this deal or not, as some say that 10 billion is sufficient, while others think we could request more from the Iranians, allowing us to develop Kandla further. Either way, a decision must be made, and [Root.GetLeader]'s view on the matter will ultimately be the tie breaker..."
 PER_route_secure.5.a: "The money offered is sufficient, we should not ask more from our Iranian friends!"
 PER_route_secure.5.b: "This isn't nearly enough to risk the lives of our citizens, request more!"
 
 PER_route_secure.6: "[RAJ.GetName] declines!"
 PER_route_secure.6.t: "[RAJ.GetName] declines our Offer!"
 PER_route_secure.6.d: "Ultimately, it seems that the amount that we offered was not convincing enough for the Indians. Citing the risk to the citizens of Kandla, they request either a higher amount for the creation of even safer facilities, or to end discussions. While the Ministry of Finance is unwilling to cough out more money, the Ministry of Defense reminds us that using Kandla would ultimately guarentee that foreign powers would not interfer with the transfer from Korea. The decision now lands upon [Root.GetLeader]."
 PER_route_secure.6.a: "Fine. Do what you can to convince them, offer 20 billion!"
 PER_route_secure.6.b: "The cost of this endeavor is, ultimately, not worth it."
 
 PER_route_secure.7: "[PER.GetName]'s 2nd Offer!"
 PER_route_secure.7.t: "[PER.GetName]'s 2nd Offer!"
 PER_route_secure.7.d: "Requesting a conference, the Iranians have brought another deal to the table. They are offering 20 billion, not just for the assurance of safety, but also for the development of Kandla's port facilities. This is a very tempting offer, with both the Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry breathing down everyone's neck, urging us to take this deal. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the Iranians are deperate for this deal, and would probably offer more if we deny a third time. The Ministry of PSW disagrees, and believes that any more shenanigans would lead to this deal falling through, and that we should take it."
 PER_route_secure.7.a: "The Ministry of PSW is right, we should take what is offered."
 PER_route_secure.7.b: "No, the Ministry of Foregn Affairs believes we could get more!"
 
 PER_route_secure.8: "[RAJ.GetName] declines!"
 PER_route_secure.8.t: "[RAJ.GetName] declines our 2nd Offer!"
 PER_route_secure.8.d: "Our delegation has returned empty handed, as the Indians have declined our offer of 20 billion. The delegates say that the Indians hinted at perhaps accepting a higher offer, but it seems that they were split on taking our generous terms. Now the Minister of Finance says that they are attempting to squeeze out as much money as they can, and the Ministry of Defense agrees, however, the Minister of Defense still believes the deal to be necessary for the acquisition of nuclear weaponry. Should we end this discussion by agreeing to 30 billion, or should we end it and spare our wallets?"
 PER_route_secure.8.a: "Send the delegation, offer 30 Billion..."
 PER_route_secure.8.b: "Now they are just twisting our arm, and we shall not budge!"

 PER_route_secure.9: "[PER.GetName]'s 3rd Offer!"
 PER_route_secure.9.t: "[PER.GetName]'s 3rd Offer!"
 PER_route_secure.9.d: "[PER.GetName]'s delegation has come back with a third and final offer of 30 billion, just as the Ministry of Foregn Affairs said they would. We should take this deal while it's still on the table, if not, we might lose out on this windfall!"
 PER_route_secure.9.a: "Now we're talking!"
 PER_route_secure.9.b: "No"
 
 PER_route_secure.10: "[PER.GetName] ends Discussions!"
 PER_route_secure.10.t: "[PER.GetName] ends Discussions!"
 PER_route_secure.10.d: "Ultimately, it seems the Iranians weren't as invested in obtaining nuclear weaponry as we thought, as they have ceased negotiations, citing the cost of the endeavor not being worth it. While we are sad to see that money go, at least the headache surrounding it is gone as well."
 PER_route_secure.10.a: "Well, at least that's over"
 
 PER_route_secure.11: "[RAJ.GetName] ends Discussions!"
 PER_route_secure.11.t: "[RAJ.GetName] ends Discussions!"
 PER_route_secure.11.d: "With the money offered not being enough to convince the Indians, they have ceased allowing our delegations entry into the country for the purpose of discussing the use of Kandla for the transfer of nuclear material. While the Ministry of Defense is upset over the falling through, the Ministry of Finance says that it was ultimately for the best, as the money used for convincing the Indians could be put into developing our own weaponry within our borders."
 PER_route_secure.11.a: "Well, at least my wallet's safe"
 
 PER_route_secure.12: "Negociations fruitful!"
 PER_route_secure.12.t: "Negociations fruitful!"
 PER_route_secure.12.d: "After many discussions over the terms, the [Raj.GetName] has accepted our offer, and has allowed the Koreans to transfer what is needed via Iranian vessels through the port of Kandla, and on to Chabahar, avoiding Pakistani waters. This deal took a large amount out of our coffers, but the Ministry of Defense assures us that the deal was imperative, and that we will not regret the cooperation between our two nations."
 PER_route_secure.12.a: "Thus the meetings conclude."

 PER_route_secure.13: "[RAJ.GetName] allows Renegociation!"
 PER_route_secure.13.t: "[RAJ.GetName] allows Renegociation!"
 PER_route_secure.13.d: "The [RAJ.GetName] has had a change of heart after hours of internal discussions, and has allowed us to come back to the table to discuss our terms. The Minister of Finance suggests that we up the amount originally planned to 20 billion, as to not cause the Indians to back away."
 PER_route_secure.13.a: "Go big or go home, 20 billion!"
 PER_route_secure.13.b: "Guess I'm going home then."
