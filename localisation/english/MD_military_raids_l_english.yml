# Events
 MD_raid.1.t: "[FROM.GetName] Violates Our Territorial Integrity!"
 MD_raid.1.d: "Reports indicate that [FROM.GetLeader], the leader of [FROM.GetName], has authorized a series of coordinated attacks on our nation. This aggression suggests a blatant disregard, or confusion, about the boundaries between our territories. For many here, particularly nationalists and patriots, this is seen as an outright act of war demanding a strong response. However, others at home and abroad are urging restraint, advocating for a de-escalation to avoid a full-scale conflict."
 MD_raid.1.a: "An act of war cannot go unpunished!"
 MD_raid.1.NATO: "Trigger Article 5"

 MD_raid.4.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Pay Reparations"
 MD_raid.4.d: "In a recent address to a crowd, [FROM.GetLeader] boldly proclaimed that "not a single coin" would be paid by their government. This is a deeply humiliating moment for our state.

 MD_raid.6.t: "Retaliation!"
 MD_raid.6.d: "Our recent military operations on foreign soil have not escaped the attention of the [FROM.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Regime.

 MD_raid.10.d: "Our neighbor [FROM.FROM.GetName] has just been attacked by [FROM.GetName]! With no official war declaration prior to the strike, this is clearly a violation of regional territorial integrity by a hostile power. The region waits anxiously for their response to this strike."
 MD_raid.10.a: "Will we be next?"
 MD_raid.10.b: "They probably deserved it anyway"
 MD_raid.11.t: "[FROM.GetName] Has Conducted a Military Strike On [FROM.FROM.GetName]!"
 MD_raid.11.d: "Without any formal warning, [FROM.GetName] launched a surprise military strike against [FROM.FROM.GetName] earlier today. [FROM.GetLeader] has yet to issue an official statement regarding the attack, leaving the international community with many questions.

 MD_raid.12.a: "We will always stand by our allies!"
 MD_raid.12.b: "We didn't like them anyway"
 MD_raid.13.t: "[FROM.GetName] Calls for Sanctions!"
 MD_raid.13.d: "[FROM.GetLeader] has requested that the international community sanction us after our refusal to pay their absurd reparations. Only time will tell if the world will follow their request.\n\nWe will suffer international relation, political, and economic penalties that will worsen depending on how many other nations join the sanctions against us! Nations will be more likely to join the sanctions the more hostile they are towards us, or if they are diplomatically or economically opposed to us."
 MD_raid.13.a: "Our Economy Will Stand!"
 MD_raid.14.t: "[FROM.FROM.GetName] Requests International Sanctions!"

 MD_raid.16.d: "Following [FROM.FROM.GetName]'s provocative strikes on [FROM.GetAdjective] territory, tensions have reached a boiling point. In an uncompromising statement, [FROM.GetLeader], the leader of [FROM.GetName], declared that their government will respond decisively. They announced plans to mobilize troops and advance into [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] territory, vowing to "Subdue the rabid tyrants in [FROM.FROM.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]" and to "Restore order through force if necessary". This move underscores regional and global stability, showing the dangers that could arise from a lack of diplomacy. As it stands, diplomatic channels remain silent, heightening fears that this escalation could spiral into an uncontrollable confrontation with dire consequences for international peace and security."
 MD_raid.16.a: "What happens next?"
 MD_raid.17.t: "[FROM.GetName] Triggers NATO Article 5"
 MD_raid.17.d: "Following the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] strikes on [FROM.GetAdjective] soil, the government in [FROM.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has taken decisive action by triggering NATO's Article 5, calling upon its allies to collectively respond to the aggression. The strikes by [FROM.FROM.GetName], described as non-retaliatory and unprovoked, have significantly escalated tensions, pushing the situation to the brink of war. The decision to activate NATO's article 5 has sent shock-waves across the international stage, with global leaders scrambling to respond to what could become one of the most significant tests of the alliance in modern history. Diplomats and analysts alike warn of the far-reaching implications of this development, as the potential for further escalation looms over the globe."
 MD_raid.17.a: "The giant has been provoked"
