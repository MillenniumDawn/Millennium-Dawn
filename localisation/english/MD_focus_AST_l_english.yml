 AST_Final_Years_of_Howards_Second_Term: "Turbulent Times"
 AST_Final_Years_of_Howards_Second_Term_desc: "As Australia approaches the 2001 federal elections, John Howard is an unpopular prime minister, who many want to see resign or be voted out of office. There is also high dissatisfaction with the Liberal/National coalition. A big question on voters minds is if the countrys second biggest airline, Ansett Australia, should be bailed out. Labour supports a bailout because it would represent a significant loss of jobs, but the ruling coalition does not since they do not see it as the governments fault."
 AST_The_Effects_of_GST: "The Effects of GST"
 AST_The_Effects_of_GST_desc: "A Goods and Services Tax, or a GST, is similar to what many Europeans would call a Value-Added Tax or (VAT).

It gained assent on 8 July 1999 and came into operation on 1 July 2000. The government initially said that exemptions to GST were not possible, and hoped to pass the GST legislation with the support of independent Senator Harradine, but he ultimately voted against the legislation. However a compromise was eventually reached, involving most basic food items being exempt from GST, the GST on library purchases of books being refunded, a temporary 8% refund on school textbooks, increases to welfare payments, and greater powers to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission to oversee the implementation of the new tax regime."
