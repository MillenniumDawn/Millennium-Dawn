Several members of parliament were arrested under the charges of suspected terrorism. While this was happening, Syrian military units, some accompanied by Hezbollah militias, moved on Lebanese Army bases in order to disarm the Lebanese Army. Security for several key military installations is now shared between the Syrian Arab Army and the Hezbollah.\n\nThe Syrian government is referring to this as an anti-terrorist operation, but in practice the Lebanese Parliament is now fully controlled by pro-Syrian politicians and Hezbollah members.

 Syria.2.desc:0 "Throughout the Syrian civil war, we've had an uneasy alliance with the Tahrir Al-Sham, also known as the Al-Nusra Front. We have avoided conflict with them, so we could focus on taking out the Assad regime. However, as the dust settles, our forces are starting across the border at theirs.\n\nWe could continue the civil war, and take them out.

During the civil war, they fought mainly against ISIS with other secular and progressive militias and factions. Their end goal was to create a federal Syrian republic, though many see the area just as Western Kurdistan. Demanding that they submit to us will most likely lead into a civil war. We could always offer them limited autonomy, though this means we won't be able to fully control them. Letting them go might increase Kurdish nationalism in the area."

As the Free Syrian Army is a wide coalition of groups, we are also welcoming to islamists as long as they commit to our dream of a free Syria. The islamist militias see now the benefits of operating under a more moderate banner as it will allow them to recieve foreign support. This will increase our coordination of offensives and breath new life into our revolution."

Years of fighting this brutal civil war has turned most of the former FSA-forces under the sway of islamist ideology. Though we don't exactly agree with the Muslim Brotherhoods interpretation of everything, they are, inshallah, willing to fight together with us in a coordinated fashion, and at least believe in Sharia as the sole law and Islam as the only needed governance of Syria."

 SyriaNews.8.d:0 "With growing military pressure on the Syrian islamists of Tahrir al-Sham, their unity has broken down and their remaining forces have pledged allegiance to the Free Syrian Army Coalition in a last ditch effort to unify the strength of the Syrian rebels to be able to mount an decisive offensive against Assad's forces. It is likely the possibility of recieving foreign military aid played a large role in convincing the islamists to operate under a more moderate banner."

 SyriaNews.9.d:0 "With growing military pressure on the Free Syrian Army Coalition, their already shaky unity has broken completely down and the remaining militias have mostly pledged allegiance to the Syrian islamists of Tahrir al-Sham. Tahrir al-Sham, which has the former al-Qaeda affiliated Nusra-Front at it's core, have been more effective and successful on the battlefield against Assad's forces, and this added with the growing influence of radical ideology within many FSA-groups has made an large scale switch of allegiance increasingly more likely over time."
