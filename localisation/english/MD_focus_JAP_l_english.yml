The Japanese diet met on April 5th, 2000, to find a replacement for the Prime Minister.\nKeizō Obuchi would never recover again, eventually dying in the hospital on May 14th. He leaves behind one son and two daughters, one of them, Yūko, also a politician of the Liberal Democrats."

 japan_classic.17.o2: "The situation will rectify itself."
 japan_classic.18.t: "Yoshirō Mori's political gaffe"
 japan_classic.18.d: "On May 15th, 2000, newly elected Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori got into major negative headlines for the first time when he publicly referred to Japan as \"a Divine Nation centered on the Emperor\". This, in the eyes of both the opposition and the ruling LDP, calls the democratic ideals of Japan as well as the role of the monarchy into question.\nPublic approval ratings of the Prime Minister have dropped."
 japan_classic.18.o1: "What a fool!"
 japan_classic.18.o2: "Double down on his statements."
 japan_classic.19.t: "Fusako Shigenobu arrested"
 japan_classic.19.d: "The leader of the Japanese Red Army, Fusako Shigenobu, was arrested in Osaka on November 8th, 2000.\nThe Japanese Red Army was a militant communist militia aiming to destroy the monarchy, topple the Japanese government and start a world revolution.\nFollowing the arrests, the Japanese Red Army would soon be disbanded in early 2001."
 japan_classic.19.o1: "The communist rebels are losing ground."
 japan_classic.19.o2: "Set her free, she is right."
 japan_classic.20.t: "The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster"
 japan_classic.20.d: "On March 11th, 2011, Japan was hit by the devastating Tōhoku earthquake, followed by a tsunami, primarily hitting the north-eastern coast of the island of Honshū.\n\nMany Japanese citizens were displaced and had to leave their homes, but this is not out of the ordinary for a country living on the Pacific Fire Ring. However, the damage done to Fukushima Daiichi, one of Japan's most vital nuclear reactors, is not only out of the ordinary, but absolutely catastrophic.\nIn a nuclear disaster that only Chernobyl 1986 could measure up to, the tsunami destroyed the emergency reactors that were to cool the reactors after the automatic shutdown. The Units 1, 2 and 3 suffered nuclear meltdowns, being accompanied by hydrogen-air chemical explosions and massive release of radioactive material.\n\nThe radiation emitted by the reactor was strong enough to sentence an unprotected human to death after a mere minute; the regional area thus became uninhabitable.\n\nThe catastrophe changed public opinion on nuclear power the world over."
 japan_classic.20.o1: "A black day for our nation."

 japan_classic.70.t: "Japan seeks Chinese Alliance"
 japan_classic.70.d: "The Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] has recently announced that Japan would seek a new possible alliance with its former rival and constant adversary China.\nThe Chinese have yet to respond - but whatever Beijing's decision might be, the political climate of East Asia is changing."
 japan_classic.70.o1: "A new age!"
 japan_classic.70.o2: "Let us hope for the best."
 japan_classic.70.o3: "We shall consider our choices."
 japan_classic.70.o4: "The Chinese will make a good choice."
 japan_classic.70.o5: "How odd."
 japan_classic.70.o6: "We will destroy them anyway."
 japan_classic.71.t: "Japan embraces the Path of War!"
 japan_classic.71.d: "\"The grand Japanese heritage cannot be put into question by our past experiences and our most shameful defeat in 1945. We need to put our country and our national pride back on its feet and look forward, united, strengthened and ready to strike. We will not avoid conflict just to preserve peace. Not anymore!\"\n\nThe Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] held quite the sensational speech in Tokyo. Japan seems to have renewed ambitions for superpower status."
 japan_classic.71.o1: "We are unstoppable!"
 japan_classic.71.o2: "Hail Japan!"
 japan_classic.71.o3: "Very worrying."
 japan_classic.71.o4: "They need to be stopped."
 japan_classic.71.o5: "Do they want to get nuked AGAIN?"
 japan_classic.72.t: "Japan seeks Trade with China"
 japan_classic.72.d: "Denying American advances into the Japanese economy, the Tokyo government has announced that they would instead seek closer trade relationships with the Chinese, rather than 'selling the Japanese people to the Americans', according to the Japanese Minister of Finance."
 japan_classic.72.o1: "Good choice"
 japan_classic.72.o2: "Intriguing."
 japan_classic.72.o3: "That comes close to betrayal."
 japan_classic.72.o4: "Interesting Development"
 japan_classic.73.t: "Japan adapts Article 9"
 japan_classic.73.d: "Article 9 of the Japanese constitution states: \"Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.\"\nThis has been interpreted to not only outlaw war, but also military action abroad. The Japanese government is now getting rid of the latter clause - putting fear in the opposition that the former might be next."
 japan_classic.73.o1: "It had to be done."
 japan_classic.73.o2: "Japan is remilitarizing."
 japan_classic.74.t: "Japan abandons Defensive Principles"
 japan_classic.74.d: "With the world growing more and more tense, the Japanese government has today declared that it would be ready to defend Japanese interests and its ideological persistence both at home and, importantly, abroad.\n\nThis is a major uproar in Japanese foreign policy."
 japan_classic.74.o1: "Glory to Japan!"
 japan_classic.74.o2: "We stand by our ally."
 japan_classic.74.o3: "How worrying."
 japan_classic.74.o4: "Death to Japan!"
 japan_classic.75.t: "Japan declares Interventionism"
 japan_classic.75.d: "Japan has reassured the global community that it would stand strong in its democratic values, but that it would also pursue a more aggressive foreign policy to enforce democratic principles both at home and abroad."
 japan_classic.75.o1: "Freedom we bring and fascists we slay."
 japan_classic.75.o2: "Good choice"
 japan_classic.75.o3: "Defending democracy is a good thing at least."
 japan_classic.75.o4: "Another one of those 'democrats'. Ugh."
 japan_classic.75.o5: "We will destroy these Japs!"
 japan_classic.76.t: "Japan abolishes the Monarchy"
 japan_classic.76.d: "In a move that draws closer and closer to communistic ideology, the Japanese government has today dismantled the Chrysanthemum Throne, the position of the Japanese Emperor. The first emperor, as according to legend, sat on the throne around 650 BC; and the first confirmed emperor did so in 100 BC. Either way, the Japanese monarchy was the longest-existing monarchy in the world."
 japan_classic.76.o1: "Good riddance."
 japan_classic.76.o2: "Everything has to come to an end."
 japan_classic.77.t: "Japan empowers the Emperor"
 japan_classic.77.d: "\"Japan, in these troubled times, requires a strong and unifying leader, something that I cannot offer.\"\nThe Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] has today angered the opposition of his country and many countries across the world by giving a speech about a possible restoration of Absolute Monarchy in Japan. [JAP.GetLeader] has presented several reforms (that are expected to pass) to the National Diet in order to make the transition happen."
 japan_classic.77.o1: "Long live the Empire!"
 japan_classic.77.o2: "The Japanese are doing the right thing."
 japan_classic.77.o3: "So much for values."
 japan_classic.78.t: "Japan seeks to spread the Revolution"
 japan_classic.78.d: "\"The people of Korea are in desperate need of liberation and their workers shall be freed.\", the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Japan has declared in Tokyo.\nThis is a complete novelty in foreign policy and could mean a war in East Asia."
 japan_classic.78.o1: "Glory to Japan!"
 japan_classic.78.o2: "This is outrageous!"
 japan_classic.78.o3: "The Red Revolution is spreading!"
 japan_classic.78.o4: "We need to fight communism!"
 japan_classic.78.o5: "Totalitarianism is spreading."
 japan_classic.79.t: "Japan declares Racial Supremacy"
 japan_classic.79.d: "\"And thus, with scientific and cultural evidence, we have definitive proof that the Japanese people are the chosen race.\"\nEven if the Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] did not present the evidence he spoke of, the implications of a Japanese return to fascism through a declaration of 'racial supremacy' are very severe. Japanese foreign aggression has become very real."
 japan_classic.79.o1: "Hail us!"
 japan_classic.79.o2: "They are going crazy."
 japan_classic.80.t: "[Root.GetName] declares Mass Mobilization"
 japan_classic.80.d: "\"In the name of the safety of our people, our nation and our friends, we need every available recruit. The cynical opposition and our enemies will call this 'mass mobilization', we should rather refer to it as 'national awakening' however. This has nothing to do with foreign aggression.\"\nIn an act of foreign aggression, [Root.GetLeader], head of the [Root.GetAdjective] government, has declared a state of mass mobilization in the country."
 japan_classic.80.o1: "For the fatherland!"
 japan_classic.80.o2: "We still have their backs."
 japan_classic.80.o3: "Let's hope they don't become a threat."
 japan_classic.80.o4: "The [Root.GetAdjective] threat is growing."
 japan_classic.80.o5: "We will enjoy killing these recruits."
 japan_classic.81.t: "The Korean Unification Ultimatum"
 japan_classic.81.d: "In an originally Japanese proposal, the Tokyo and Seoul governments have issued a joint statement called \"Joint Japanese-Korean Demand for Democracy for the Korean People\", in which the two countries threaten North Korea with war in order to unify the Korean Peninsula under Seoul leadership.\nA response is expected not only from Pyongyang, but also from Beijing."
 japan_classic.81.o1: "Let's go!"
 japan_classic.81.o2: "How dare they?!"
 japan_classic.81.o3: "We will stand by our allies."
 japan_classic.81.o4: "Pyongyang is justified."
 japan_classic.81.o5: "What is even happening?"
 japan_classic.82.t: "China beats Japan into submission!"
 japan_classic.82.d: "Japan has dropped its demands to the North Korean after the Chinese government called out partial mobilization of its forces and began moving towards the North Korean border, ready to cross it like they did in the 1950s to once again save Pyongyang from utter destruction.\nJapanese diplomatic reputation is tarnished and South Korea has made a fool of itself."
 japan_classic.82.o1: "Shameful display!"
 japan_classic.82.o2: "Victory is our destiny!"
 japan_classic.82.o3: "It is peace in our time."
 japan_classic.83.t: "China refuses to aid North Korea!"
 japan_classic.83.d: "\"The Chinese government has no further interest in propping up the failed North Korean state. Our protection for them is null and void.\"\nIn an unprecedented and unexpected move, the Chinese government has abandoned North Korea to its fate in the face of approaching Japanese and South Korean troops."
 japan_classic.83.o1: "And what a good choice that is."
 japan_classic.83.o2: "It had to be done."
 japan_classic.83.o3: "TRAITORS! TRAITORS!"
 japan_classic.83.o4: "North Korea stands no chance."
 japan_classic.84.t: "North Korean officials flee the country!"
 japan_classic.84.d: "In the middle of the night, North Korean government officials have fled the country in the face of growing civil resentment and the impending Japanese and South Korean invasion. Several trains left the country for Russia and China, with a government-in-exile possibly in the process of being formed."
 japan_classic.84.o1: "That means victory!"
 japan_classic.84.o2: "Well, they can have refuge for now."
 japan_classic.84.o3: "Farewell, world."
 japan_classic.84.o4: "North Korea is no more."
 japan_classic.85.t: "The North unites Korea!"
 japan_classic.85.d: "\"This is the greatest victory of our time. The once oppressed people of the south are now free to live and enjoy life together with their northern brethren, as the almighty eternal ruler intended.\"\nNorth Korean Leader [NKO.GetLeader] held a speech in Seoul, the former capital of South Korea, today. South Korea has failed in the eternal struggle of these two different versions of a Korean nation state. The entire country is now ruled from Pyongyang."

In the seemingly eternal struggle of the two Koreas against each other, North Korea finally collapsed and gave way to a stronger South Korea, now simply called Korea.

 japan_classic.88.t: "Taiwan reconquers China!"

 Japan.8.d: "China has revived their dispute with us over ownership of the Senkaku islands.

Rather than resulting in a Chinese retreat which has historically occurred after similar incidents, Japanese aircraft were fired upon, resulting in the deaths of several Japanese pilots and the loss of multiple aircraft.

With huge government bailouts to prop up key enterprises and banks, the response to the crisis built up one of the largest public debts in the world. The bad business environment in Japan leads Japanese corporations to invest very little inside of Japan, with profits instead put into abroad or government bonds to sustain the huge debt. Due to deflation, the rise in the value of the Yen, this gives stable profits for savers even with minuscule or negative interest rates, leaving no incentives to consume or invest in the real economy. This deflation allows Japan to sustain huge debts that would make any other country bankrupt. Unfortunately, it also ensures anemic economic growth with no solution in sight."

 JAP_finish_gaikando: "Finish Ken-O"
 JAP_finish_gaikando_desc: "The entire open of Ken-O Expressway circumventing the central Tokyo will ease the traffic jam, and it will directly bring a logistic improvement."
 JAP_biomass_town: "Biomass Town"
 JAP_biomass_town_desc: "The Islands of Japan have less underground resources, moreover there is no crude oil. However it might be complemented by the convert of the agricultural grain to the bio fuel."
 JAP_methane_hydrate: "Flammable Ice"
 JAP_methane_hydrate_desc: "Japan has less of the land but the vast ocean, and the vast ocean has not only plenty of water but also the vast bed. And the research showed, there is an abundant mineral of \"flammable ice\" - methane clathrate. The 21st century's technologic evolution brought to be able to dig the sea bed and retrieve the flammable ice, but it will cost expensive and may cause an environmental ill effects..."
 JAP_liquefaction: "Liquefaction of Waste Plastic"
 JAP_liquefaction_desc: "Another solution of disposed waste plastics is that recycle them, liquefy them, and convert them into the petroleum."
 JAP_millennial_coal_liquefaction: "Millennial Coal Liquefaction"
 JAP_millennial_coal_liquefaction_desc: "The coal is not the old resource of a century ago. Like Japan and Germany tried during the WWII, we can retry to liquefy the coal - but in the modernised, evolved and environmental way. Perhaps, it will revive the old deserted coal town again..."
 JAP_chuo_linear_shinkansen: "Chuo Linear Shinkansen"
 JAP_chuo_linear_shinkansen_desc: "This futuristic electromagnetic railway is not using the iron and just floating from the surface, but run in 313 Mph, connect from Tokyo to Nagoya in a half hour and to Osaka in a hour. And now is the future. We revive and re-realise the \"dream of super-express\" again."

 #INTERNAL POLICIES

 JAP_trinity_reform: "The Trinity Reform"
 JAP_trinity_reform_desc: "Employment, bureaucracy, education- our fiscal reform must approach all three areas of Japan's vulnerable state with care, or we are doomed to turn the Lost Decade into many more Lost Decades to come."

 #ECONOMICS AND LABOUR
 #----------------------------------------------------------------
 JAP_neoliberalism_TT: "\n§GNeoliberalism will quickly escape deflation by boosting the available workforce and reducing staffing needs to immediately fill positions, rather than directly growing the population.§!\n§RIt will later struggle to maintain this level of growth, depending more on social services or foreign puppets to grow its GDP.§!\n\n§GThis path favors aggressive investment and expansionism.§!"
 JAP_socialism_TT: "\n§GSocialism will gradually escape deflation by growing the population and decreasing the expectation of social subsidies to satisfy the population. It synergizes well with the Trade Unions internal faction.§!\n§RIt will resolve the depopulation issue quickly, but the effects will take longer to reach the economy.§!\n\n§GThis path favors vertical growth and pacifism.§!"
 JAP_union_interest_TT: "§GThis will satisfy the labor unions!§!\n"

 JAP_large_boned_policy: "'Honebuto' Policy"
 JAP_large_boned_policy_desc: "Normally, the Ministry of Finance drafts the national budget based on the ruling party's positions. Some in the LDP are calling for this arrangement to be revised in order to combat the consquences of the Lost Decade, giving the Diet greater influence over what the Ministry of Finance proposes. They are calling this the 'Big-Boned' policy."
 JAP_socialism: "Japanese Socialism"
 JAP_socialism_desc: "The welfare of Japanese citizens cannot end at pensions and healthcare. Childcare and elderly that do not have families to rely on must be covered as well. We cannot allow this become a partisan issue! "
 JAP_protect_worker_rights: "Protect Workers' Rights"
 JAP_protect_worker_rights_desc: "Words are not enough. To guarantee the rights of workers- and to placate the unions- we will pass some simple legislation to extend workers' rights to temporary contractors who do not typically enjoy the same protections as traditional employees."
 JAP_save_ice_age: "Save the Ice Age Generation!"
 JAP_save_ice_age_desc: "During the Lost Decade, an entire generation of graduates became stranded with no opportunities by a failing economy. The effects of this have been catastrophic, with spiking rates of suicide and a sense of hopelessness among young adults who have given up on society. Some of these fall to despondent, radical thoughts. We must provide hope to the Lost Generation."
 JAP_neoliberalism: "Japanese Neoliberalism"
 JAP_neoliberalism_desc: "We must enrich all Japanese citizens by providing them the opportunity to succeed. To that end, we must help businesses grow. We must not be tempted by easy taxation promises that will strangle our tender economy and impoverish more than ever before."
 JAP_deregulate_temporary_staffing: "Deregulate Temporary Staffing"
 JAP_deregulate_temporary_staffing_desc: "One measure we can immediately take to promote growth is to extend the circumstances in which companies can legally staff positions with temporary contractors. This will help get more people working without businesses needing to commit to hiring them as an employee, at least for some time. Of course, the unions will object."
 JAP_national_investments: "Assertive Samurai Bond Investment"
 JAP_national_investments_desc: "Japan enjoys one advantage from its tepid interest rates- it is quite attractive to foreign actors that wish to seek investment from Japanese investors. We could liquidate a few of our unprofitable international investments in order to finance some bond packages with some of our neighbors, which could have a positive effect on our domestic economy."
 JAP_liberal_syndicalism: "Trade Union Representatives"
 JAP_liberal_syndicalism_desc: "Reserving some seats in the Diet for representatives of major trade unions would give the unions a direct route to address their concerns to the national assembly and make them more cooperative with political issues. The question is, how much influence do we actually want to give them over elections?"
 JAP_labour_management: "Labour Management Director"
 JAP_labour_management_desc: "Ideally, businesses should resolve labour issues before they become an issue of national policy. To accomplish this, we will reward large businesses that reserve a seat on their board of directors for trade union representatives."
 JAP_industrial_union: "National Labour Union"
 JAP_industrial_union_desc: "In Japan, the local unions are the first negotiator in labour disputes before they have a chance to escalate. Normally, the labour federations help fund the smaller unions with their dues, but this means that many local unions must make do with inadequate funding. We will standardize how dues are collected and distribute them to each union directly."
 JAP_struggle_high_low: "The Struggle of High and Low"
 JAP_struggle_high_low_desc: "It is too simplistic to blame everything on capitalism, or to dismiss our reforms as communism. Our nation must be unified in spirit, devoted to each other and our respective talents. The worker and the owner, the state and the citizen, each of these cannot exist without the other. We will become one organism, and overcome adversity together."
 JAP_universal_child_benefit: "Universal Child Benefit"
 JAP_universal_child_benefit_desc: "The government will grant the subsidy of growth, to every child, born in Japan, growing in Japan, and going to any schools in Japan, without any discrimination by the familial roots."
 JAP_ban_zangyo: "Ban Minashi Zangyou"
 JAP_ban_zangyo_desc: "Karoshi- death by overwork- has been on the rise for several years, as a consequence of a shrinking workforce. We cannot overcome the societal pressure to accept predatory overtime expectations through social change alone, we must leglislate protection that protects workers from their own sense of obligation."
 JAP_nenko_wage: "Reinterpret the Nenko Wage System"
 JAP_nenko_wage_desc: "The old seniority-wage system was flawed in many ways, but its removal has left many retirees who planned around it with insufficient savings that their pensions cannot compensate for. We're ready to change this. We can roll our social reform progress into a new pension, childcare, and unemployment system that protects all Japanese citizens."
 JAP_discretionary_labour_laws: "Legislate Discretionary Labour"
 JAP_discretionary_labour_laws_desc: "Discretionary labour allows for an employee's salary to factor potential overtime into a static rate, which enables employers to supervise their employees less. Of course, this method can and has been abused to pressure employees to work more for less pay. We need to make sure it's flexible but fair. "
 JAP_subsidy_optimization: "Subsidy Optimization"
 JAP_subsidy_optimization_desc: "One of the largest complaints that small businsses have with applying for subsidies is how top heavy the system feels. For a simple bond or relief package, the noodle stand must fill out the same paperwork meant for Mitsubishi. We will have to dedicate a lot of effort to changing this, but we will remove one of the largest impediments to small businesses."
 JAP_elder_labour: "Shogai Gen'eki"
 JAP_elder_labour_desc: "We have made mistakes with handling the older generation in the workplace. We should not force them out of work, but we must also support those whose financial situations necessitate a return to work. We should provide resources to help small businesses coordinate with interested elderly workers to live an 'Active Long Life'."
 JAP_rebuild_lost_generation: "Rebuild the Lost Generation"
 JAP_rebuild_lost_generation_desc: "The shape of labour in Japan is forever changed, and the workforce is finally starting to become comfortable with that fact. Young workers feel that they can balance their work and life, older workers feel valued by their companies and communities. And, we did it without destroying our economy!"
 JAP_price_escalation: "Controlled Price Escalation"
 JAP_price_escalation_desc: "Businesses are growing the fastest they have in a decade, but we need to prepare for a wave of labour returning to the workforce. We will print enough currency to encourage new construction, but we must capitalize on this burst of growth in order for it to be worth the resulting devaluation of the Yen that will follow!"
 JAP_counter_union: "Cabinet-Led Union Counter-Offensive"
 JAP_counter_union_desc: "Large and small companies alike are complaining that union demands are depressing their ability to hire more contract workers. We need to push back against the labour unions' influence in major industrial conglomerates with an information campaign to lower worker membership rates."
 JAP_union_liaison: "Council for Industrial-Union Affairs"
 JAP_union_liaison_desc: "We have dramatically modernized the way labour in Japan functions, and not all aspects of industry have been able to catch up. We need to ensure that the trade union federations and the industrial interests are able to shake hands after so much of society has changed. To do this, we will create a council to coordinate the needs of both."
 JAP_national_minimum_wage: "National Minimum Wage"
 JAP_national_minimum_wage_desc: "Japan's minimum wages are different among the prefectures; it is higher in the metropolis like Tokyo and Osaka, and lower in the countryside like Aomori and Kagoshima. If the wages are standardised across the country, ."
 JAP_intern_training: "Technical Intern Training Program"
 JAP_intern_training_desc: "The developing countries of East Asia, in particular, have a growing demand for advanced technological training. At the same time, we need to fill positions with temporary workers. This is a great way to provide a modest boost to our workforce, but we must take care that we treat these interns humanely, otherwise this could look bad for us with our neighbors."
 JAP_relaxed_immigration: "Relax Immigration Restrictions"
 JAP_relaxed_immigration_desc: "Japan's population needs to recover before it can begin to recover its economy. The simple fact is that the population cannot recover until the econom does. We are stuck in a paradox that can only be solved from outside. This will make many people on both sides of the political arena upset, but this is a matter of national survival."
 JAP_migrant_monitoring: "National Migrant Database"
 JAP_migrant_monitoring_desc: "A strong migrant population is great for the workforce, but our relaxed policies must be compensated with careful monitoring of suspicious persons who reside in our country. A comprehensive list of all migrants- and their history- can only be accomplished with computer assistance. We will apprehend and deport those who cannot abide by Japanese law before they can bring harm to our citizens."
 JAP_improved_naturalization: "Help Foreign Workers"
 JAP_improved_naturalization_desc: "We will reorganize some tax laws and coordinate with several countries we already have visa agreements with so that foreign workers will enjoy more favorable financial conditions while working in Japan, such as streamlining their tax documentation. This does not mean we will commit to more open immigration, but we will make life easier for foreign workers."
 JAP_control_labour_immigrants: "Streamlined Naturalization Process"
 JAP_control_labour_immigrants_desc: "We will standardize a way for foreign nationals seeking permanent residency to accelerate their application. Normally, foreign nationals must reside in Japan for 10 years before earning eligibility for permanent residency. If they speak Japanese fluently and have a stable source of income and career experience, this could be shortened to just 3 years."
 JAP_maternity_tax_reduction: "Expanded Maternity Benefits"
 JAP_maternity_tax_reduction_desc: "Women on maternity leave receive several benefits and compensation already, but we can extend this to fathers taking time off to take care of their family. Additionally, we can subsidize families for each additional child they have. It will be expensive, and reduce our nominal workforce for a time, but the baby boom will pay off."
 JAP_adoption_tax_reduction: "Expanded Family Campaign"
 JAP_adoption_tax_reduction_desc: "Unfortunately, many couples that don't fit into the image of the traditional Japanese family are exempt from many benefits afforded to typical families. Expanding our support for adoption is a great way for us to help house children that otherwise must remain under the direct care of the state."
 JAP_shine_all_women: "A Society Where All Women Shine"
 JAP_shine_all_women_desc: "Japan must adapt its expectations as a modern society. Men must no longer feel that they are expected to be the sole providers for a family any longer. We must encourage women who are willing to support a family with a full time job. To do this, we must encourage women to seek opportunity- and assure them that they will not be turned away."
 JAP_yamato_nadeshiko: "Yamato Nadeshiko"
 JAP_yamato_nadeshiko_desc: "In order to inspire and motivate women, we must change the way they are viewed by society. They must not be treated as delicate flowers to shun when they reach towards opportunity. Japan cannot remain in the past- we must be willing to let go, even if it means leaving behind a piece of our sentimentality in the past."

 JAP_oversight_forum_TT: "If we complete the focus §LTrade Union Representatives§!, we will receive additional political power!"
 JAP_ldp_fracture_TT: "We will be compelled to leave major institutions §Ycorporatized§! later, instead of full privatization!"
 JAP_ldp_fracture_corp_only_TT: "Have not promised to retain some key services as §Ycorporatized§! entities OR §Y[conservatism_L]§! is Not in Power."
 JAP_central_government_reform: "Central Government Reform"
 JAP_central_government_reform_desc: "Despite actions to privatize many companies in the 80s and 90s, the bureaucatic system that runs Japan's services is inefficient and, in some cases, prone to corruption. Some voices call for smaller government, other voices just want greater accountability for civil servants. Either choice has its drawbacks and will not be easy to reverse course from."
 JAP_cease_privatization: "Suspend Privatization Schemes"
 JAP_cease_privatization_desc: "Cutting nationalized services will not make life easier for our citizens, and the overhead from trying to sell off shares of public companies may even increase our debt further. Instead, we should improve the bureaucratic system so that it actually delivers what the people expect from it and, most importantly, is trusted by the people."
 JAP_cease_privatization_TT: "\n§RThis path increases government expenditure,§! §Gbut makes it easier to intervene in the economy.§!"
 JAP_full_independent_audit: "Full Independent Audit"
 JAP_full_independent_audit_desc: "The Kaikeikensain, or Board of Audit, is responsible for reviewing the government's expenditures and comparing them to the budget to ensure finances are being appropriately allocated. Often, submissions to the board are confusing and difficult to read, as the given guidelines are not subject to censure when violated. We will change this, and verify our expenditures are above, at, or below budget."
 JAP_oversight_forum: "Representative Oversight Forum"
 JAP_oversight_forum_desc: "The seats in the Diet should not just be filled with warm bodies. We will put into practice a new system of parliamentary oversight to review the local effects for the laws passed by current and previous administrations. We will collect information through surveys and non-political groups in order to repeal laws that have negatively impacted the people."
 JAP_ombudsman: "National Financial Ombudsman"
 JAP_ombudsman_desc: "Though there are options for citizens to lodge complaints at a local level, the impact of national laws on citizens is largely invisible to the national government. We can create an office designed to process complaints and disputes regarding civil services and ensure these services are reaching everyone."
 JAP_third_agrarian_reform: "Third Agrarian Reform"
 JAP_third_agrarian_reform_desc: "There are many small plots of undesirable, abandoned land that is privately owned but not being exploited for development. Due to the economic effects of the Lost Decade, there is little desire to sell off these lands, and adjacent farmers are unwilling to pay a high price. If we buy these lands at asking price and distribute them to farmers, it will stimulate the land market and increase productivity."
 JAP_continue_privatization: "Continue Privatization Efforts"
 JAP_continue_privatization_desc: "The issue of the postal service's inefficiencies and failures is the final straw in a long list of ways the Japanese bureaucratic system has betrayed the society it is supposed to provide for. We are in a unique position to change the trajectory for Japan's economy, even if the discourse surrounding it splits the party."
 JAP_continue_privatization_TT: "\n§GThis path reduces government expenditure,§! §Rbut makes it harder to intervene in the economy.§!\n\nCompleting this as the conservative wing of the §BLiberal Democratic Party§! will cause the §Yliberal§! wing of the LDP to split off and join the opposition!"
 JAP_service_corporatization: "Civil Service Corporatization"
 JAP_service_corporatization_desc: "In order to transition more civil services to the private sector, we will put up shares of these formerly nationalised services on the market. This will allow us to sell off our own shares and reduce our debt, but will throw our services into chaos, forcing us to spend more in the short term."
 JAP_corporatization_goal: "Corporatization Goal"
 JAP_corporatization_goal_desc: "Corporatization of civil services lets the government retain ownership of all shares in the company. This helps with fiscal transparency and market competition, but it doesn't help relieve our tax burden from running these companies when they do poorly. However, it is sensible to keep certain financial and infrastructure companies at this level of ownership."
 JAP_privatization_goal: "Full Privatization Goal"
 JAP_privatization_goal_desc: "Selling all shares of our reorganized service companies to stockholders has benefits beyond the added pressure to profit- we can financially assist them more readily when their market is threatened without as much public objection, as well as tax their revenue when their market is performing well."
 JAP_end_arp: "End 'Gentan' Policy"
 JAP_end_arp_desc: "The Acreage Reduction Policy is the result of a complicated price fixing scheme developed in the 70s. In short, today's large farmers take Gentan subsidies to produce soybeans or other crops in place of rice; in exchange, they limit their production of rice to keep prices high. If we're going to phase out Gentan, we need to decide how we're going to do it."
 JAP_end_arp_tt: "\n§GWe will have to balance how much expense we want to shed from our bureaucracy spending versus the overhead of supporting our agriculture.§!"
 JAP_anticorruption_committee: "Accountable Fiscal Reform"
 JAP_anticorruption_committee_desc: "A strong government must have a transparent system of accountability for all officials with the authority to make important decisions. This means more than just a strong audit board, it means close examination of all financial ties, relationships, and promises of officials. If any incident of corruption gets past this barrier, it will be embarrassing and costly for us to clean up."
 JAP_anticorruption_committee_TT: "\n§GThis path will reward us for rejecting corrupt opportunities!§!"
 JAP_digital_archives: "Digital Personnel Management"
 JAP_digital_archives_desc: "If we want to be able to manage a leviathan of state documents, submitted subsidies, and investigative subpoenas across many different prefectures, we simply cannot search each document by hand. We must convert our millions of long term documents to a secured, redundant digital storage system. This will allow any oversight bureau to track the dealings of officials much more carefully."
 JAP_anticorruption_computerization: "Oversight Reduction Policy"
 JAP_anticorruption_computerization_desc: "With a strong emphasis on countering corruption before it takes root, we can make assumptions in our fiscal and personnel policy to make effective reductions in our expenses devoted to policing our bureaucracy. We will only benefit from these optimizations, however, if we maintain a bureaucratic culture that rejects corruption."
 JAP_anticorruption_TT: "Will give §YAccountable Fiscal Reform§! the following bonuses, so long as we maintain §Gnegligible corruption§!:\nPolitical Power Gain: §G+0.25§!\nTax Revenue Multiplier: §G+5.00%§!\nPolice Cost multiplier: §G-30.00%§!"

 JAP_anticorruption_gained_TT: "We will gain the positive effects of the §LAccountable Fiscal Reform§!."
 JAP_countercorruption_law: "Counter-Corruption Law"
 JAP_countercorruption_law_desc: "We cannot possibly create a system that will catch all cases of backdoor dealings that will also be cost effective. Instead of trying to stop corruption before it appears, we should create the framework for a system that rewards those who blow the whistle on illicit activities."
 JAP_countercorruption_law_TT: "\n§GThis path will make it easier for us to recover from corruption!§!"
 JAP_diet_countercorruption: "Expanded Diet Investigative Powers"
 JAP_diet_countercorruption_desc: "Now that we have established a precedent for cracking down on corruption, we will take the next logical step. An amendment to the Counter-Corruption law will give the Diet wide-reaching power to investigate inappropriate cordiality between officials and businesses."
 JAP_iron_triangle: "Crush the Iron Triangle"
 JAP_iron_triangle_desc: "The relationship between bureaucratic officials, businessmen, and politicians has a fatal flaw- the ambition of opposing politicians. We will push to allow the minority government in the Diet to call for special inquiries against the ruling coalition in certain circumstances. This will slow down our government's ability to act, but will make corruption almost trivial to root out by creating an incentive to find it."
 JAP_reacquire_public_corporations: "Expand Public Ownership"
 JAP_reacquire_public_corporations_desc: "Prior privatization measures were intended to reduce the national debt, but the economic slump has not produced the competition needed to materialize the fair prices it was meant to provide. We will buy back enough shares to hold a majority of these companies. It's not an option to allow our most vulnerable people go without affordable rail and telecom."
 JAP_wealth_taxation: "Reorganized Taxation System"
 JAP_wealth_taxation_desc: "The second phase of reacquiring public services is a complete redraft of the taxation system. We have to change how we interact with corporations to cover the cost of reacquiring public services. This will be a difficult road and will harm corporate productivity, but merely trying to grow our way out of debt has not worked for a decade. It's time for a new approach."
 JAP_nationalise_infrastructure: "Nationalize Major Industries"
 JAP_nationalise_infrastructure_desc: "The ultimate goal of state ownership is the central control of all critical infrastructure. This includes transportation networks, telecom, air and sea terminals, resource extraction, and power generation, to name a few. All of these, when managed like a business, can be profitable. Stability is more important than profitability in the 21st century."
 JAP_green_investment: "Payment for Ecosystem Services"
 JAP_green_investment_desc: "State control over infrastructure is a mire of expenses and bureaucracy we do not want to commit to. Instead, our control should nudge infrastructure, resource extraction, and power generation towards sustainable solutions through incentives and subsidies. Ultimately, we hope to see a careful evolution of the economy, not a revolution."
 JAP_redundant: "Redundant Sustainability"
 JAP_redundant_desc: "Japan's vulnerability to natural disasters means that it is also vulnerable to disruptions to the global supply chain. Evolutions in renewable energy will help reduce dependency on unreliable fossil fuels as well as expensive nuclear expansions, as well as protecting our infrastructure through redundant power systems."
 JAP_e_japan: "e-Japan"
 JAP_e_japan_desc: "Interaction with bureaucracy should be as easy as possible. Renewing documents, applying and paying for titles and permits, and submitting claims should be instant and easy for all citizens. To do this, we must expand internet bandwidth and coverage. Even quiet, traditional mountain villages will soon have wireless service."
 JAP_abolish_privilege: "Bureaucratic Privilege Assessment"
 JAP_abolish_privilege_desc: "Some state employees, such as Diet representatives, enjoy special privileges that, in addition to being controversial, are taxing on the budget. Special rent prices, free travel, an excessive allowance on top of their salary. These must be evaluated and adjusted to what is actually necessary to do their job."
 JAP_cut_off_salary: "Cut Bureaucrats' Salary"
 JAP_cut_off_salary_desc: "We cannot afford to cut any more public services, for the sake of our peoples' well being. Instead, now that we have an effective measure to prevent corruption, we will reduce the excessive salaries that many bureaucrats enjoy. With strong corruption oversight in place, there is little fear of any opportunists trying to make up the difference."
 JAP_bureaucracy_amendment: "Bureaucratic Reform Amendment"
 JAP_bureaucracy_amendment_desc: "New agencies and services added to the budget will require the Diet to come to a fiscal concensus, first. This will create a barrier to new spending that encourages reform over addition. This will increase the trust in our level of taxation, rather than cutting it further."
 JAP_concessional_water_business: "Utilities Privatization"
 JAP_concessional_water_business_desc: "We will go further than just the postal services. Introducing competition to utilities, like water collection and processing, will help provide better service and maintenance to the aging infrastructure that supports it. This will ultimately provide better prices to customers, once factored into the tax relief they will receive."
 JAP_tourism_and_casino: "Tourism and Casino Business"
 JAP_tourism_and_casino_desc: "Gambling in most forms is illegal in Japan. Though this is a socially responsible measure, it means that a lucrative market for tourism is totally closed off. Worse, it encourages illegal gambling, enriching criminal organizations. Legalizing and regulating the gambling market will bring in more revenue, as well as fight crime."
 JAP_private_social_securities: "Social Securities Privatization"
 JAP_private_social_securities_desc: "Complete privatization of social services will require comprehensive reform of the private pensions market. Aside from creating a special company from the Social Insurance Agency, the first step is to open up options for those who want to opt out of the National Pension. This will be expensive at first, but we will save our citizens massive amounts in taxation in the long term."
 JAP_2nd_government_reform: "Second Central Government Reform"
 JAP_2nd_government_reform_desc: "Creating greater transparency and accountability in our bureaucratic system has helped, but we are left with a tangle of laws that are redundant- and, in some cases, full of loopholes. A second wave of legislation and reform will revitalize our bureaucatic system, reducing costs and trimming unnecessary staffing."
 JAP_anti_revolving: "Destroy Amakudari"
 JAP_anti_revolving_desc: "Amakudari (\"Descent from Heaven\") is the Japanese name for the revolving door phenomenon in politics. Bureaucrats and politicians entering the private sector invites corruption unless we control it, but we also don't want to leave those workers without a job."
 JAP_government_safeguard: "To Safeguard"
 JAP_government_safeguard_desc: "Government's role is to secure, not provide. We will protect businesses from threats they could not anticipate, but we will not coddle them and reward them for failing to plan ahead. Business shall not guide the hand of policy."
 JAP_legislated_revolving: "Reinterpret Amakudari"
 JAP_legislated_revolving_desc: "Bureaucratic cooperation with business is dangerous, but not itself harmful. Danger can be mitigated with regulation and control over business to moderate how much influence it has in politics. We can then reap the benefits of efficient coordination between public services and private needs."
 JAP_government_enrich: "To Enrich"
 JAP_government_enrich_desc: "Government's role is to enrich. This extends to business, as well. To do this, we will reinvest corporate taxes back into businesses according to policy agreed upon by both public and private companies and moderated by union leaders. The boundary between public and private is blurred in the 21st century, and we will embrace it!"

 #EDUCATION AND IDEOLOGY
 #----------------------------------------------------------------
 JAP_mil_sunrise: "Millennium Sunrise"
 JAP_mil_sunrise_desc: "Media, technology, and education are all part of the vastly expanding information spectrum that developed nations depend on. In order to recapture Japan's place at the forefront of the world's research and development, we must reinvigorate all three of these fields out of the scars of the 20th century."
 JAP_dissolve_kisha_club: "Kisha Club Reform"
 JAP_dissolve_kisha_club_desc: "Press clubs are intended to ensure that accredited journalists have easy, immediate access to information direct from sources in companies and the government. In reality, the kisha clubs of Japan shake hands and exchange favors with the entities they are supposed to keep watch over. We need to regulate and diminish the exclusive nature of these associations."
 JAP_domestic_journalism: "Domestic Media Freedom"
 JAP_domestic_journalism_desc: "Large media companies dominate the information space in Japan. Freelancers and small outlets have a difficult time getting access to information before it becomes monopolized by large media conglomerates. After regulating the kisha clubs, we must now go after institutional favoritism."
 JAP_journalism_solidarity: "Press Freedom Goal"
 JAP_journalism_solidarity_desc: "Ultimately, the goal of press freedom is to nurture a responsible, stable society that can adapt and police itself, regardless of ideology or outlook. We will commit to removing obstructive laws, monetary obstacles, and ultimately tear down the culture of silence that domestic reporters are compelled to submit to."
 JAP_alpha_influencer: "Cultivate Internet Influence"
 JAP_alpha_influencer_desc: "The rise of internet platforms like bloggers and \"Youtubers\" is a serious challenge to conventional media- and, by extension, the stability of information reaching ordinary people. This is the future of information, and we should invest in building a presence for national media on these platforms now."
 JAP_global_journalism: "Global Internet Presence"
 JAP_global_journalism_desc: "Other countries wield national media as a powerful tool for international influence. Classic giants like the BBC and newer contenders like Al-Jazeera have the eyes and ears and- most importantly- minds of millions who live beyond their home country's borders. Japan must seize this emergent form of soft power by expanding funding for NHK-World from a TV channel to a multimedia giant."
 JAP_cultural_export: "Digital Cultural Export"
 JAP_cultural_export_desc: "To many foreigners, Japanese culture is the image of East Asia. This demand for Japanese cars, Japanese noodles, Japanese beer also exports our cultural influence. The internet is no different: we will export Japanese media websites, multilingual animation, and digital concerts. With these, millions around the world will become invested in Japan as an idea."

 JAP_e_commerce_ease: "Ease of Entry"
 JAP_e_commerce_ease_desc: "Deregulating domain hosting will have several tradeoffs. Small businesses, shops, and stands will be able to advertise and sell their brand online, but this also means that illicit businesses will enjoy the same ease of access. Citizens will have a forum to speak freely, but foreign actors will also be able to pose as nationals and foment discord."
 JAP_parallel_internet_society: "Parallel Society"
 JAP_parallel_internet_society_desc: "The simple fact is that the internet is a social ecosystem outside of traditional society, and it is a waste of resources to try to force it to conform. We will establish several laws that protect unconventional commentary and anonymity on the internet- in all of its strange, esoteric forms."
 JAP_flexible_copyright: "Adaptive Copyright"
 JAP_flexible_copyright_desc: "Japanese copyright law is extremely strict and, in some ways, unsuited for the internet age. As an example, under current law, there is no provision for a \"fair use\" of material for criticism or discussion. Providing this, among other concessions, would encourage organizations as well as ordinary citizens to draw attention to issues in media."
 JAP_freedom_of_internet: "The Free Internet"
 JAP_freedom_of_internet_desc: "The internet is a tool- dangerous in some ways, but it also offers great opportunity to enrich society. Trying to pin down and proof the internet against abuse is an exercise in futility- instead, we should embrace the potential the internet has to inspire individuals to create, innovate, and share."
 JAP_e_commerce_strict: "Regulated Domain Hosting"
 JAP_e_commerce_strict_desc: "Unscrupulous domain hosts rarely care about the legitimacy of companies and individuals they provide service to. This makes it so that an illicit website can start up, direct unsuspecting users to fraudulent services, and then disappear before the operators can be prosecuted. Holding domain hosts accountable puts responsibility on them to moderate their services."
 JAP_control_internet_society: "Part of Society"
 JAP_control_internet_society_desc: "Strange, deviant subcultures congregate on internet forums and use tools like Tor or VPNs to conceal their identity, and then use this anonymity to defame and harass people. Some of these forums embrace distasteful comparisons to terrorist cults like Aum Shinrikyo. There is a limit to what civilized society can tolerate, and these cultures are well past it. We will restrict the extent to which online anonymity may exist."
 JAP_strict_copyright: "Strict Copyright"
 JAP_strict_copyright_desc: "Copyright is, in practice, binary. A holder either owns the rights to their work or they own nothing. Intellectual property is a serious issue in the 21st century, not only for domestic concerns but international patent theft as well. If we are not strict in enforcing copyright law, then it will be abused."
 JAP_national_network: "Integrated Inter-Network"
 JAP_national_network_desc: "The internet is a tool- one of great opportunity, but also one of extreme danger. We must treat it like any other territorial domain: as a critical area of Japan's national security. The average domestic user will hardly notice any change, but criminals, terrorists, and foreign agents will be foiled by a comprehensive national subnet."

 JAP_new_generation: "A New Generation"
 JAP_new_generation_desc: "The world is changing, and Japan must change with it if its people are to thrive. Whether the Western-aligned principles are correct or if Japan must take a new trajectory is unclear, but we must open our culture up to the possibility of change, or change will tear apart our inflexibility."
 JAP_new_generation_TT: "\n§GThis path will make it easier to change Japan's political outlook!§!"
 JAP_counter_tiger_mothers: "Combat the Kyōiku Mama"
 JAP_counter_tiger_mothers_desc: "\"Tiger Parents\" who put unrealistic expectations on their children are a symptom of a narrowing society, where success is only recognized by the pinnacle of achievement. This unrealistic expectation placed on youths in a stagnant market is destroying an entire generation. We do not want to be like Korea or China, so we must encourage the middle-achievers."
 JAP_dori_edu: "Dōri Principle"
 JAP_dori_edu_desc: "The time of ducking one's head and accepting irrationality is over. If Japan is to advance into the 21st century, it must have talented and driven youths that are willing to speak when their heart questions why something nonsensical is holding back progress."
 JAP_evolving_conservatism: "Evolving Conservatism"
 JAP_evolving_conservatism_desc: "Japan is changing, whether the old generation likes it or not. If we are to control the manner in which Japan changes, we must seize the hearts of the next generation. Stubbornly digging our heels and looking to the past for answers has failed to inspire the last generation of families and students, we will not make the same mistake."
 JAP_evolving_conservatism_TT: "\n§GThis path will make Japan's conservative parties more popular!§!"
 JAP_jiko_sekinin: "Jiko-Sekinin Theory"
 JAP_jiko_sekinin_desc: "Coming off of the Lost Decade's impact on society, the idea of \"Self-Responsibility\" must adapt to consider those who fell on hard times at no fault of their own. We need to motivate youths who fear they will be part of the next Lost Generation by sharing some of that responsibility as a society."
 JAP_new_dotoku: "Dōtoku Principle"
 JAP_new_dotoku_desc: "Times change, the world evolves, governments fall, but the heritage of Japan stands above time. The Dōtoku, or moral education, of youth must teach them to honor integrity in themselves and in society. An expectation of moral behavior must come from within, not outside."
 JAP_reflection: "Textbook of Reflection"
 JAP_reflection_desc: "The wounds between Japan and its Asian neighbors are not points of shame to avoid confronting. They can be a point of healing that can bind our nations together, so long as we are willing to reflect on our role and accept that we are better now than we were then."
 JAP_reflection_TT: "\n§GThis path will open diplomatic channels with more Asian countries!§! Take this if you want to interact more with other countries."
 JAP_reaching_out: "Reaching Out"
 JAP_reaching_out_desc: "Japan has a reputation of waiting for others to concede a point first before offering a concession in turn. This cannot persist in our cultural ties any longer- we must show that we are willing to make ourselves vulnerable."
 JAP_historical_apology: "A Final Apology"
 JAP_historical_apology_desc: "The details are unimportant, and that's what the Chinese and Koreans want us to accept. Arguing over the specifics of our crimes shows that our interests lie more with ourselves than those we hurt. We will make every attempt to show how we have changed."
 JAP_beacon_democracy: "Asia's Torch"
 JAP_beacon_democracy_desc: "Korea struggles on and off with authoritarian rule, Vietnam still bears scars of its civil war, Thailand and Myanmar are wracked by coups and changes in government. We are in a unique position to lead by example and guide Asia towards lasting stability."
 JAP_beacon_democracy_TT: "\n§GFuture attempts to lead Asian diplomacy will be more successful!§!"
 JAP_distance: "Textbook of Distance"
 JAP_distance_desc: "Japan's past history with other Asian countries is regrettable and tragic, but we should not follow Germany's example of self humiliation, as we are not Germans. We must study our past clinically and with somber distance, so that our youth may grow up able to think critically rather than emotionally."
 JAP_distance_TT: "\n§GThis path will improve Japan's internal stability!§! Take this if you are uninterested in foreign entanglement."
 JAP_strengthen_ties: "Strengthen Ties"
 JAP_strengthen_ties_desc: "It is fruitless to prostrate ourselves before the Communist Chinese and the Koreans, trying to placate their insatiable desire to humiliate and overtake Japan. Rather, we should reach out to those Asians who view us favorably. The Taiwanese and Indonesians, despite our history, today see us as a positive influence. We should embrace them."
 JAP_affirm_responsibility: "Affirm Our Responsibility"
 JAP_affirm_responsibility_desc: "We have already apologized for crimes that the Chinese and Koreans have demanded we humiliate ourselves further over. It is time for us to move on and memoralize our guilt for the final time, even if others refuse to accept it."
 JAP_kizuna: "Kizuna"
 JAP_kizuna_desc: "More than anything, the cultural cold war has shown us the importance of reinforcing the kizuna- the bonds- that we have, rather than failing to make new ones. Our friends overseas are important- we will make sure they feel loved as they love us."

 JAP_k_computer: "Supercomputing Developments"
 JAP_k_computer_desc: "Japan's achievements in high performance computing obviously demonstrate our technical ability to the world, but they also serve practical purposes. Supercomputers can be used to process incredibly complex simulations that a traditional computer would take years to produce results for. Retaking our place as the leading supercomputing power is paramount to our research efforts."
 JAP_interdiscipline_science: "Interdisciplinary Science"
 JAP_interdiscipline_science_desc: "Scientific advances are valuable beyond a monetary return on investment. When scientists and their students are given grants to iterate their research uninterrupted, they are more concerned with finding out the answer rather than the next profitable exchange on an R&D contract."
 JAP_commercialism_science: "Commercialized Science"
 JAP_commercialism_science_desc: "Recklessly handing out grants without any foresight is an inefficient and wasteful way to guide research. Using national research laboratories to accept private R&D contracts focuses research on what is most in need of attention to society."
 JAP_selection_and_concentration: "Selection and Concentration"
 JAP_selection_and_concentration_desc: "As part of our national laboratory reform, we need to decide how to move forward with our research funding policies. Dumping money into our laboratories is sure to bring results, but also great expenses. Some are suggesting we optimize what our research grants, instead."
 JAP_humanities: "Earthquake Studies Program"
 JAP_humanities_desc: "There is a strong interest from both the public and private sector in furthering advances in earthquake-resistant construction. If we help coordinate this research, we can overcome the geological complications with living on our seismically active home islands."

 JAP_protect_faculty: "Technical University Grants"
 JAP_protect_faculty_desc: "Software is a booming market, and advances in technology are changing the way that software interfaces with the physical world. AI, 3D printing, and wireless communications are rewriting the rules of production at scale. We need to help organize these advances towards an objective."
 JAP_protect_faculty_TT: "\n§YDepending on our choice of research funding, this focus will have different costs.\n\n§GLean funding will give us a small amount of political power!§!\n§YOptimal funding will cost us $$10B.§!\n§OHeavy funding will cost us $$30B.§!"
 JAP_protect_academism: "Social Sciences in Government"
 JAP_protect_academism_desc: "Okinawa- or, more appropriately, the Ryukyu Islands that it is a part of- has a latent independence movement. Though it has waned in popularity in recent years, it is a source of instability in Okinawa Prefecture. Studies and surveys of the population will help us insulate the effects of this instability."
 JAP_nation_of_science: "Genetic Science Advances"
 JAP_nation_of_science_desc: "Genome sequencing has leaped forward in sophistication over the past decades, bringing huge health and science benefits. Owed in part to this, life expectancy is trending upwards- we must take advantage of this if we are to keep our aging society healthy and productive."
 JAP_nation_of_science_TT: "\n§YDepending on our choice of research funding, we will receive different rewards for§! §Ggene sequencing technology.§!\n\n§GLean funding will provide a modest bonus for no cost!§!\n§YOptimal funding will provide a decent bonus for a small cost.§!\n§OHeavy funding will provide the same bonus as optimal but at a higher cost.§!"
 JAP_reorganise_universities: "Space Technologies"
 JAP_reorganise_universities_desc: "Industry-Academia-Government: these three bodies form a triple helix of coordinated development towards solving practical and theoretical problems. This can only be realized through streamlining communication and strengthening oversight in order to eliminate the wasteful allocation of funds- both public and private."
 JAP_reorganise_universities_TT: "\n§YDepending on our choice of research funding, this focus will have different costs.\n\n§GLean funding will give us a small amount of political power!§!\n§YOptimal funding will cost us $$10B.§!\n§OHeavy funding will cost us $$30B.§!"
 JAP_san_gaku_kan: "Form JAXA"
 JAP_san_gaku_kan_desc: "After a period of dormancy following the Lost Decade, it is time to revitalize our space technology. We will reorganize our existing space organizations into a unified agency. The new Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency will be the primary avenue for helping us expand our satellite constellations."
 JAP_reboot_sigma: "Reboot SIGMA"
 JAP_reboot_sigma_desc: "The Sigma Project was an ultimately failed attempt to standardize software development architecture during the 80s. In reality, it created a software ecosystem that lagged behind the rest of the world, just like the Soviets' attempt. We will change our approach: embrace the world's modern software design philosophies and overtake them with quality."
