 economy_tutorial_gdp_desc: "In MD, a country’s GDP is calculated based on active buildings and other factors. GDP per Capita is also calculated by dividing GDP by the population.\n\nGDP represents the size of a country’s economy and affects various aspects, such as determining the national spirit for country rank (e.g., Superpower, Minor Power, etc.) that is applied to all nations and provides various modifiers, influencing research slots, and determining interest rates based on the ratio to national debt (explained later).\n\nGDP per Capita indicates the wealth of a nation’s population.
