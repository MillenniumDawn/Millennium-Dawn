 israel_news.1.t: "Alleged Nuclear Target in Syria Strikes"
 israel_news.1.d: "More than seventeen tons of bombs have been detonated over a military site known as the 'Bustan' southeast of Dier Ezzor in Northeastern Syria late this night, right next to the Euphrates. While many options have been raised to indicate the potential perpetrator of the strike, Western analysts have pointed at Israel as the most likely actor to conduct such a strike due to intelligence reports suggesting it is, in fact, a reactor belonging to Syria's alledged secret nuclear program constructed with North Korean aid. It is unclear wether the reports have been true or not, and to what degree was the U.S. Administration informed of the strike, but as [SYR.GetLeader] swiftly moves to remove any evidence pointing at a nuclear program, one thing is clear - twenty-six years after it destroyed Iraq's first nuclear program, the Begin Doctrine is still maintained by Israeli policymakers."

 israel_news.3.t: "The Jeddah Treaty"
 israel_news.3.d: "Ever since the signature of the Abraham Accords with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and [ISR.GetLeader]'s secret visit to Jeddah to meet the heir to the Saudi Throne, many wondered wether Riyadh will follow in the footsteps of Abu Dhabi and throw its covert ties to Israel outside of the closet. Today, it had finally happened. After [SAU.GetLeader] gave his blessing for a treaty in exchange for American military guarantees and Israeli concessions on the Palestinian issue, [USA.GetLeader] had invited the Saudi Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister to sign an official peace treaty. This opens the door for further cooperation in light of shared threats across the Middle East and the Saudi desire to use Israeli high-tech investments to diversify its economy."

 israel_news.4.d: "Sounds of sirens, explosions, ashes and crashing airplanes - these were the views late tonight seen and heard by millions of Iranians across multiple regions of the country. Israel, wether with military support or just knowledge of Washington, has assaulted the Islamic Republic with dozens of IAF planes, aimed at the country's nuclear targets. This shouldn't have suprised no one - as for decades now, Jerusalem had threatened military action to prevent Iran from ever reaching a nuclear weapon, in accordance to the Begin Doctrine and following similar actions against Syria and Iraq. But this strike wouldn't go unfollowed. Already, hundreds of thousands of Israel civilians have entered shelters and anti-air systems were put on high alert, prepared for the thousands of direct missiles which would inevitably come raining on Israeli cities."

Turkish and American diplomats have announced final drafts of a comprehensive agreement have been agreed to between delegates from Damascus and Jerusalem, and Swiss government officials are preparing for a ceremony attended by [ISR.GetLeader] and [SYR.GetLeader].

Greece, long seen as the most hostile nations towards Israel in regards to the Palestinian Question, had aligned itself to Jerusalem to form a united front against Turkish demands in the sea, and to export Israeli and perhaps Egyptian gas towards the European Union. Turkey had reacted with fury, with  [TUR.GetLeader] declaring it would not prevent Turkey from achieving it's 'blue homeland', and declaring he ordered the expulsion of Israel's ambassador from Ankara. the European Union, led by France, have welcomed these developments."

Diplomats of the Iranian Provisional Government have arrived on a direct flight from Tehran to Ben Gurion International Airport, from which they visited Yad VaShem and then reached the Knesset, where a treaty was signed - ending the state of war between Israel and Iran that have existed since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, included a promise to end supporting resistance group standing in opposition to the other, and establish embassies in eachother's countries. In the wake of Iran's Second Revolution which ended with the overthrow of the Mullahs, this seems like a critical milestone in reestablishing the strong Iranian-Israeli strategic alliance from the times of Reza Shah, and in the spirit of Cyrus who released the Jews from captivity in Babylonia."

 israel_news.8.d: "Shocking news have come out of Israel today. In recent times, many Arab states have abandoned the boycott initiated by the Arab League at the Khartoum Conference towards - if not embracing, than atleast accepting Israel; atleast for the sake of economic opportunities, fear of a regional power vaccum, and fears over mutual global enemies. Today, this relationship has grown from bilateral ties to an official alliance, signed between [ISR.GetLeader] and many Arab ministers and statesmen in Tel Aviv. This alliance's goal is clear: Create a strategic and political architecture for the Middle East in an era where American power projection in the region is dwindling, to balance against shared rivals and end the bloodshed the region had seen for decades. Indeed - it can be seen as an American victory which easens its pivot to Asia to counter Beijing's influence in the Far East."

The foreign ministers agreed to make a meeting of the forum be a yearly event, each time in a different desertly area. Many observers pointed to this as the next step of the Abraham Accords, moving beyond simple normalization to full-on alliance between Israel and many of the moderate Sunni Arab Nations around it. It is unclear wether it would consolidate to a full military alliance, but it is a historic step in Israeli efforts to secure its future in the Middle East."

 israel_news.10.t: "Israel initiates Limited War over Syria"
 israel_news.10.d: "The intensification of the civil war in Syria led to a power vaccum in many of the areas still held by the Damascus government, a vaccum to which Tehran has stepped to fill up the void. While in support of the Syrian regime, Iran had used the opportunity to put permanent presence of Hezbollah fighters - alongside other Shiite militias and headed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - in Syria, as a base from which to expand Iranian influence and the revolution and for the 'day of command' against Israel. However, Israeli policymakers according to foreign sources have informed their European and American counterparts that Jerusalem cannot stand idle and allow Syria to 'Become a Second Lebanon', and hence are preparing 'all options on the table.' Foreign sources point to a potential aerial campaign against Iranian militia targets all around the country, while avoiding regime targets to not be viewed as intervening in the civil war outright."

 israel_observer_african_union: "African Union Observer State"

 israel_economy.162.t: "Israel wants to become AU observer state!"
 israel_economy.162.d: "Israeli relations with Sub-Saharan Africa flourished in the 195s and 196s. However, in the Yom Kippur War, Israeli forces crossed the canal and came into occupation of African soil. This resulted in most of the continent - essentially everyone except for Malawi and the Apartheid Regime in South Africa, including us - cutting off relations with the country. These relations were gradually restored in the 199s following the Oslo Accords, and many in the Israeli government see Africa as the continent from which Israel can improve its international image. Prime Minister [ISR.GetLeader] has recently launched a campaign to 'Return to Africa', using our salinization technologies and other innovative start-ups to improve the lives of the African people. As such, Jerusalem has approached us requesting to join the African Union as an observer state, similarly to the PLO. While many, especially in the EAC would support it, Algeria and especially South Africa declared strong opposition for the move."
 israel_economy.162.a: "[ISR.GetLeader] is a true friend of Africa."
 israel_economy.162.b: "Apartheid States have nothing to do in Africa."

 israel_economy.163.t: "Ethiopia Agrees!"
 israel_economy.163.d: "Yesterday in the opening ceremony of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia has submitted to the Chairperson of the African Union Commission Israel's charter as an observer member to the African Union. In the 199's, Israel was an observer member of the Organization of African Unity, until it was dissolved and replaced by the African Union. However, it failed to rejoin due to pressure from South Africa and Algeria - two of the continent's largest nations. But not anymore. A political bloc, mainly led by Botswana, Ethiopia and members of the East African Community have managed to overpower the Arab-South African bloc and push this admission. This diplomatic achievement is the result of endless efforts by the Foreign Ministry, the African Division and Israeli embassies on the continent. This is a corrective step to the anomaly that has prevailed for almost two decades and is an important part of strengthening Israel's foreign relations fabric."
 israel_economy.163.a: "Great!"

 israel_economy.164.t: "Ethiopia vetoes our status!"
 israel_economy.164.d: "In a vote today in the African Union Commission regarding Israeli accession, our hopes were proven futile. Despite strong support from Botswana, Ethiopia, members of the East African community and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it was not enough to overpower the voices opposed to our accession to observer state status in the African Union. In the 199's, Israel was an observer member of the Organization of African Unity, until it was dissolved and replaced by the African Union. However, it failed to rejoin due to pressure from the Arab states as well as South Africa. Indeed, It is saddening to see the African Union taken hostage by a small number of extremist states like Algeria and South Africa, which are driven by hatred and controlled by Iranian and Qatari interests. Israel will continue to deepen its ties with Africa, no matter wether via the African Union or via backdoor channels and no matter how huminliating was it to watch our diplomats violently expelled from the chamber following the vote."

Party leader Ariel Sharon and his moderate supporters announced their withdrawal from the party and the formation of a new political party, Kadima.

israel_labour.2.d: "Today it became known about the creation of a new political party - £ISR_democrats the Democrats, which appeared as a result of the merger of the  £ISR_socialism Labor Party and the  £ISR_neutral_Social Meretz Party. This event was not unexpected for the society, because historically these parties have always cooperated and acted as a single coalition in elections and the creation of £ISR_democrats the Democrats was a logical step in the relationship between these parties. In fact, it is not a complete unification, at the moment the parties still have separate budgets and independent factions in the municipalities, but one way or another this union has a good chance in the elections and a bright future ahead."
