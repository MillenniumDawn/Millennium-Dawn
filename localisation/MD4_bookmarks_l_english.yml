 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The World Today"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Never has hunger been lower. Never have incomes been higher. Yet the world is marked by fear in the face of rapid social and technological change. The backlash to globalization is felt as the Middle East collapses into hybrid warfare and a wave of nationalist populism rolls over the West. The gravity of the world is shifting towards Asia, but the emerging powers of the world have yet to find an attractive alternative to the prevailing western world order."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 SYR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With divided loyalities in the Syrian Armed Forces and staggering losses from 6 years of fighting a brutal civil war, the regular Army is a spent force. It's place on the Syrian battlefield has been taken by wide array of Militias, Private Military Companies, Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, who together have begun to reverse Assad's losses. However, with it's economy destroyed, and most of Syria's territory under the control of Terrorists, Rebels and Kurds, the prospect of a united Syria looks certain to be a long struggle ahead."
 FSA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Initially the Free Syrian Army was a umbrella-organization of anti-Assad rebel groups and a true government in paralell. However, radicalization of Syrian militants led to mass defections to both Al-Qaeda ally Al-Nusra and ISIS and the erradication of the FSA in the north of Syria. As a result, the Free Syrian Army was dismantled as an organization. However, a wide array of Muslim Brotherhood linked rebel groups together with smatterings of salafists and secular groups still keep the label. In the South of Syria, FSA-label groups have been successful in desert warfare against ISIS, and still defends most of Daara from Assad's forces. In the north, the Turkish Army intervention has been successful in creating a wedge between the two Kurdish cantons."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Through previous austerity and reforms, the German economy remained unscathed from the dual shocks of the 2008 financial crisis and the European debt crisis. As by far the strongest European economy, it has fallen on the once careful and unwilling Germany to lead the European Union forward in the face of Brexit and increased calls for national sovereignity. For Germany, the Eurozone and European Union is not a choice, but a nessessity - in giving it an combined market large enough for it's goods - as the strong German industrial sector has long since outstripped it's own internal demands. Furthermore, with downward trending demographics, Germany must rely on increased immigration to fill the vacuum - a choice that is sure to be controversial with nationalism on the rise."
 ROJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the Syrian Civil War began, Assad's forces withdrew from the Kurdish areas to defend it's heartland. This allowed the long repressed Kurdish people, through the left-wing Democratic Union Party and it's militia, YPG, to take control and establish Rojava, based on democratic socialism and gender equality. As ISIS entered the Syrian battlefield, they targeted the Kurds with force, taking over large swaths of Rojava, culminating in the failed assault on Kobane. With reinforcements from the Peshmerga, the Turkish PKK and US air support, the Kurds were able to turn the tide and send ISIS on the run. Since then, it has incorporated parts of the old FSA under the banner of the 'Syrian Democratic Forces'. However, it's future challenges remain many, with Turkey repeatedly threathening war and fears looming that it's lukewarm alliance with Assad might break down into conflict."
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "China's geography - surrounded by mountains and jungles - protects it, but also isolates it from the rest of the world. As an multi-ethnic empire with large minorities, just maintaining it's territorial integrity takes considerable effort, as it needs to provide massive investments in it's hinterlands and disputed territories to maintain control. It's perhaps largest volunerability, however, is it's dependence on exports and trade on the open ocean - which is controlled by the United States and it's Asian-Pacific allies. For China to become an true superpower, it needs to compete with the US Navy in size and quality, and to turn current Asian rivals into allies. China's diplomacy is hampered by it's lack of an attractive political model. However, it is boosted by it's massive foreign reserves and it's willingness to use them to invest abroad."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The fall of the Soviet Union reversed 300 years of Russian expansionism and left the new federation with it's 17th Century borders. The expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe and post-Soviet states has left it volunerable, as it's heartland lie on the European plain - which is indefensible. Thus, gaining indirect control over post-Soviet states such as Ukraine, Georgia and the Baltics via initiatives such as the Eurasian Union is paramount if Russia is to ever again amount to anything more than a regional power with an decent military. Economically, she must overcome the dual shocks of low oil prices and western sanctions, and somehow tackle the rampant corruption in Russia's highly centralized buerocracy."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States, the world's sole superpower, faces an gradual decline in international power from being bogged down in Middle Eastern wars, government debt and the economic rise of China and other BRICS nations. However, due to it's unique geographic position - offering it total safety with no natural enemies, it can remain engaged overseas in force to defend both the US and it's allies vital interests. At home, a wave of nationalist sentiment against both elitism and globalization has left it with it's most unlikely president ever - Donald Trump. \n\nWith European and Asian allies having fears about both american unilaterallism and a withdrawal from western liberal institutions - can the US strike the balance that will make the western world order prevail?"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 MILLENNIUM_DAWN:0 "Millennium Dawn"
 MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "The world has changed. Globally speaking, an atmosphere of peace and prosperity has ruled for about half a century. But with the recent end of the Cold War, the recent rise of the People's Republic of China, how will this world see itself? How will it shape itself? Will the United States continue its dominance? Will the new Russian Federation find the way into the spotlight? What roles will the former great European empires of Britain, France and Germany play? And what role will the shadow of terrorism have? The world has changed. The world is changing."
 CHI_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "China, the backwater of yesterday, is the super power of tomorrow. Its industrial base great, its political influence growing, its military modernizing and its workforce nearly infinite, China has to fear only one thing: If it reforms too slowly, it might be destroyed. If it reforms too quickly, it might destroy itself."
 FRA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "France, the Grande Nation of old, has tried to find a new spot in an ever-changing world. With old rivals and old friends firmly by her side, with new opponents and new threats on the horizon, France will have to decide if the future of the cradle of democracy shall be unity and peace or a return to more darker times."
 GER_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Germany is now reunited for almost a decade. Economically stronger than ever, though with the outlook of a recession in the future, Germany needs to find new goals in this world. The freshly independent states of Eastern Europe are in the process of joining the European Union, where Germany holds significant influence. Germany, though troubled by its dark past, looks at a bright future."
 JAP_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Japan, the second-biggest economy on earth, has been the powerhouse of East Asian democracies ever since the Second World War ended. Backed by American and European allies and protected by a powerful industrial base, Japan looks at its old rival China with new confidence and new potential for conflict."
 SOV_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it was clear that the path back to glory would not be easy for the Russian Federation. The system and economy corrupt, the military big but outdated and the political outreach weakened, Russia had to accept to be on the sidelines for a decade. Now, it is looking to get back into the spotlight."
 ENG_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "With Hong Kong handed over to China in 1997, the United Kingdom has seen its last great colonial possession go. The once mightiest nation on earth is trying desperately to find a new path to greatness and glory. But will that path lie in continued cooperation with the United States? Should Britain draw closer to its European brethren? Or shall Britannia, on her own, rule the waves once more?"
 USA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "The citizens of the United States have known little but victory in the last century. Winning the World Wars, winning the Cold War; the United States had a nearly perfect track record up until now. But with China emerging on the side of the ocean, with Russia pushing for renewed greatness, with terrorism an ever so great threat, what can America do to stay dominant?"
 OTHER_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan. The wars of the past have left the nations of the present fearing for the future. However, there is great hope that humanity might have passed 20 centuries of bloodshed to complete its transition to a period of peace and stability."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
