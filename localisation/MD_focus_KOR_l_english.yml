 KOR_the_rok_armed_forces: "The ROK Armed Forces"
 KOR_the_rok_armed_forces_desc: "The Republic of Korea's existence is defined by its constant vulnerability. Clashes with the North are constant reminders of the threat that the DPRK poses to our citizens' security. Beyond the peninsula, we must remain vigilant against new and old enemies that would wish to do us harm. To guard against all such threats, our armed forces must be as strong as they possibly can be."
 KOR_foreign_procurement: "Foreign Procurement"
 KOR_foreign_procurement_desc: "While over the years we have developed a robust domestic arms industry, there are gaps in our indigenous capabilities that are better filled by equipment imported from abroad."
 KOR_p8_poseidon: "The P-8 Poseidon"
 KOR_p8_poseidon_desc: "It is time for our aging fleet of P-3Cs to be retired. These maritime patrol aircraft have only detected 28% of North Korean submarines involved in exercises, and therefore need to be replaced with newer models. The Boeing P-8 Poseidon was developed by the US to replace its own P-3Cs. It may be wise for us to follow the example of our strongest ally."
 KOR_c295: "The C-295"
 KOR_c295_desc: "It is time for our aging fleet of P-3Cs to be retired. These maritime patrol aircraft have only detected 28% of North Korean submarines involved in exercises, and therefore need to be replaced with newer models. The Spanish C-296 MPA is a significantly more affordable option than the P-8, but is generally considered an inferior aircraft."
 KOR_upgrade_f16s: "Upgrade F-16s"
 KOR_upgrade_f16s_desc: "Contracting Lockheed Martin to bring our F-16s up to the F-16V standard is an important stop-gap measure to maintain the effectiveness of our air force before we make the transition towards a a fifth generation fighter."
 KOR_order_f35s: "Order F-35s"
 KOR_order_f35s_desc: "It will be impossible for the Republic of Korea Air Force to match its more advanced rivals in the region without acquiring a fifth generation aircraft. The impressive stealth capabilities of the F-35 make this American-manufactured marvel a worthy addition to our aircraft inventory."
 KOR_blue_water_navy: "Towards a Blue Water Navy"
 KOR_blue_water_navy_desc: "While our navy has served us well in the past, in order to effectively defend our maritime sea lanes of communication in the 21st century we will need to start transitioning towards a blue-water navy."
 KOR_kss_program: "KSS Program"
 KOR_kss_program_desc: "The Korean Attack Submarine program is an important project that seeks up to build up the ROK Navy's domestic attack submarine capability. Now that our domestic manufacturers have learned from the technical know-how of German and Swedish submarine manufacturers, the time for an indigenous Korean submarine is upon us."
 KOR_ffx_program: "FFX Program"
 KOR_ffx_program_desc: "Guided missile frigates are a key part of the Republic of Korea's coastal defense. Regular clashes with the North Korean navy have proven the worth of these ships. As such we should invest time and money into the fleet of frigates that has defended our shores from hostile forces."
 KOR_kdx_program: "KDX Program"
 KOR_kdx_program_desc: "Our experimental destroyer program is a key part of our naval modernization effort. Not only do destroyers help the ROK Navy defend our country's immediate maritime periphery, but they also help extend the reach of our naval forces, in doing so helping us reach our goal of a blue-water navy."
 KOR_lpx_program: "LPX Program"
 KOR_lpx_program_desc: "Our amphibious landing ships are the pride and joy of our planned rapid response fleets, furthering the dream of an ROK Navy that has the ability to strike quickly and decisively across long distances. It is only by achieving a blue-water navy that we can guarantee the security of our territory, including the Dokdo islands after which the first of our LPX vessels is named."
 KOR_jeju_complex: "The Jeju Complex"
 KOR_jeju_complex_desc: "Jeju island's strategic position on the southern-most tip of the peninsula makes it the ideal location for an expanded naval base that can host our strategic mobile fleet. From Jeju the pride of our navy will be able to protect the maritime sea lanes of communication that cross the East China Sea."
 KOR_expand_dockyards: "Expand Dockyards"
 KOR_expand_dockyards_desc: "In order to reach our goal of a world-class 21st century navy, we must ensure that we have the capacity to build the necessary ships."
 KOR_ship_building_effort: "Ship-Building Effort"
 KOR_ship_building_effort_desc: "By subsidizing our ship-building industry, we can accelerate the progress of our efforts to strengthen our navy."
 KOR_a_smart_navy: "A Smart Navy"
 KOR_a_smart_navy_desc: "The 21st century demands a navy that fully incorporates the most up-to-date technology available. By implementing ICT-based systems, our smart navy will become more adaptable and flexible than the ROK Navy's more sluggish and technologically inferior rivals."
 KOR_modernize_the_army: "Modernize the Army"
 KOR_modernize_the_army_desc: "The state of army is far from ideal. Despite being one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world, the equipment of the average Korean infantrymen is embarassingly old-fashioned. The demographic pressures of our low birth-rate must mean that we cannot rely on troop numbers alone to guarantee the ROK's security. Quality must be favored over quantity."
 KOR_rd_funding: "R&D Funding"
 KOR_rd_funding_desc: "In order to improve our military capabilities we must make use of one of the ROK's strongest assets, our advanced industrial capacity. To do this we must invest in the development of new military technologies."
 KOR_rifle_modernization_program: "Rifle Modernization Program"
 KOR_rifle_modernization_program_desc: "While the Daewoo K2s that our troops are currently equipped with have served the country well, their Cold War-era design does not match our aspirations for the ROK Army."
 KOR_next_generation_ifvs: "Next-Generation IFVs"
 KOR_next_generation_ifvs_desc: "For a fast and effective land force infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) serve an important function. Deadly against men and armor alike, our IFVs will be a match for the strongest of our potential adversaries."
 KOR_tank_improvements: "Tank Improvements"
 KOR_tank_improvements_desc: "With the development of an indigenous main battle tank design, our reliance on foreign models will be eliminated. Developing and improving upon the K2 Black Panther must be a priority for our domestic arms industry."
 KOR_women_in_the_special_forces: "Women in the Special Forces"
 KOR_women_in_the_special_forces_desc: "As it stands not all of the positions in our armed forces are open to all. This cannot continue given our growing manpower deficit, and a growing need to acknowledge the fact that women have the ability to perform just as well as men. Any brave female volunteer should be able to join the special forces, so long as they meet the high standards of those units."
 KOR_ticn_program: "TICN Program"
 KOR_ticn_program_desc: "The Tactical Information Communication Network program will update our current outdated, inefficient voice-operated modes of communication. This digital network will help with large-scale information distribution, allowing for a much more responsive and flexible military force."
 KOR_bolster_cyber_security: "Bolster Cyber Security"
 KOR_bolster_cyber_security_desc: "Our increasing reliance on digital systems such as TICN program, while strengthening our armed forces, also makes us vulnerable to cyber threats. We must increase our cyber security capabilities in order to guard against this growing danger."
 KOR_it_augmentation: "IT Augmentation"

 KOR_warrior_platform: "Warrior Platform"
 KOR_warrior_platform_desc: "The equipment of the average Korean infantrymen unfortunately does not meet global standards, and Korean War-era equipment still remains in use. We should rectify this by ensuring that each individual soldier is equipped with modern equipment, such as up-to-date body armor, weapon optics and night-vision goggles."
 KOR_new_uniforms: "New Uniforms"
 KOR_new_uniforms_desc: "A warming climate and increasingly urbanized environment means that our existing uniforms are in need of replacement. A new camouflage pattern will help ensure that our troops are well-suited to the battlefields of tomorrow."
 KOR_focus_on_the_sof: "Focus on the SOF"
 KOR_focus_on_the_sof_desc: "The ROK's special forces have played an essential role in performing operations that require the skill and precision that ordinary troops cannot match. A concentrated effort to improve the training and equipment of these forces will help make the units under the ROK Army's Special Warfare Command some of the most effective in the world."
 KOR_slimmer_but_smarter: "Slimmer but Smarter"
 KOR_slimmer_but_smarter_desc: "Through the Warrior Platform program, the ROK Army has succeeded in providing each individual Korean soldier with cutting edge technology, allowing even a single infantryman to function as an effective fighting force. This means that even with reduced troop numbers, our military will be able to respond decisively to any hostile force."
 KOR_korea_aerospace_industries: "Korea Aerospace Industries"
 KOR_korea_aerospace_industries_desc: "KAI is our foremost aerospace and defense company. Established as a merger of Samsung Aerospace, Daewoo Heavy Industries' aerospace division and the Hyundai Space and Aircraft Company, KAI combines the technological know-how of Korea's most prominent defense contractors. Without KAI's assistance it will be impossible to develop indigenous aircraft."
 KOR_korean_helicopters: "Korean Helicopters"
 KOR_korean_helicopters_desc: "Our traditional reliance on vastly outdated foreign helicopters is no longer satisfactory. We now have the capability to develop our own helicopter models, and as such should strive to send Korean designs into the air."
 KOR_next_generation_uavs: "Next-Generation UAVs"
 KOR_next_generation_uavs_desc: "Unmanned aerial vehicles have become essential to modern-day militaries. Whether it is for surveillance or close air support, the Korean military cannot do without its own UAV designs."
 KOR_experimental_fighter: "Experimental Fighter"
 KOR_experimental_fighter_desc: "The KF-X program will produce a next-generation multirole fighter for our air force, ending our reliance on American fighters. While some have cast doubt on our country's capacity to build such an aircraft, with KAI's assistance we will able to realize this vision."
 KOR_korean_space_program: "Korean Space Program"
 KOR_korean_space_program_desc: "A viable space program has become the mark of an advanced, powerful nation. Developing our own capability to send astronauts into space will prove to the world and to our own citizens just how far our country has come since its humble beginnings."
 KOR_conscription_policy: "Conscription Policy"
 KOR_conscription_policy_desc: "The issues that our army suffer from are not limited to outdated equipment alone. Korea's low birth-rate and its associated demographic cliff means that our already worrying small manpower pool continues to shrink. Moreover, many of our conscripts suffer from poor morale due to their resentment of the coerciveness of national service, while others refuse to serve altogether."
 KOR_tolerate_objectors: "Legalize Conscientious Objectors"
 KOR_tolerate_objectors_desc: "The criticism we have received for our harsh treatment of conscientious objectors is well-founded. A country that has come to value human rights as much as we do cannot be seen to be coercing its own citizens to serve in the army. We should therefore allow conscientious objectors to serve their country through other, less objectionable means."
 KOR_maintain_hardline_approach: "Maintain Hardline Approach"
 KOR_maintain_hardline_approach_desc: "Our country has not survived for this long without the discipline and resilience that comes with compulsory national service. Allowing conscientious objectors to go unpunished will ultimately make our country more vulnerable to the ever-present northern threat."
 KOR_reduce_conscription: "Reduce Conscription"
 KOR_reduce_conscription_desc: "The size of our military will never be able to match that of our northern counterpart. We must instead focus on maintaining a leaner, but more committed army and play to our strengths."
 KOR_require_naturalized_citizens: "Require Naturalized Citizens to Serve"
 KOR_require_naturalized_citizens_desc: "Our manpower shortage can be addressed by requiring naturalized citizens as well as those born in the ROK to serve in the armed forces. While this will help counteract a reduction in draftees due to Korea's shrinking population, it will discourage foreigners from acquiring Korean citizenship."
 KOR_repeal_article_92_6: "Repeal Artice 92-6"
 KOR_repeal_article_92_6_desc: "Our criminalization of same-sex relations in the military through Article 92-6 has led to criticism from human rights organizations and pro-LGBTQ+ activists. Repealing this law would end this unwelcome attention and reduce the number of conscientious objectors."
 KOR_favor_traditional_values: "Favor Traditional Values"

 korea.8.t: "Radical Korean Movement Gains Popularity"
 korea.8.d: "Economic inequality in the Republic of Korea has contributed to growing dissatisfaction among the country's lower classes. Thousands of online activists have begun calling for the greater equality through the establishment of community-level autonomy throughout the ROK. While the movement is leaderless and therefore lacks a central, clear message, the majority of its members seem to desire an abolition of the Korean state and the chaebols that it is tied to in favor of a system that distributes political and economic power among directly elected community-level representatives.\n\nThis new ideology, which rejects the foundational ideologies of both the ROK and the DPRK, represents a significant departure from the traditional politics of the South Korean radical left, which has either promoted leftist policies within South Korea's existing political system or called for the establishment of a North Korean-style state."
