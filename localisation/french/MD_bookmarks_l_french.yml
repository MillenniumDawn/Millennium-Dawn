 MODERN_DAY_NAME: "Le Monde aujourd'hui"
 MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Jamais la famine n'a été si rare. Jamais les revenus n'ont été si élevés. Et pourtant le monde est marqué par la peur vis-à-vis des rapides évolutions sociales et technologiques. Le contrecoup de la mondialisation se fait sentir tandis que le Moyen-Orient s'effondre dans des guerres hybrides et qu'une vague de nationalismes populistes s'étend en occident. Le centre de gravité mondial se déplace vers l'Asie, mais les puissances émergentes du monde doivent encore trouver une alternative attrayante à l'ordre mondial occidental en place."
 USA_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Les États-Unis, seule superpuissance du monde, font face à un déclin progressif de leur puissance internationale. Entre l'enlisement dans des guerres au Moyen-Orient, la dette de l'État et l'émergence économique de la Chine et d'autres pays des BRICS, l'hégémonie américaine n'est plus ce qu'elle était. Néanmoins, grâce à sa situation géographique unique qui lui offre sécurité sans ennemi naturel, l'Amérique peut rester fortement engagée outre-mer pour défendre à la fois ses intérêts vitaux et ceux de ses alliés. Au pays, une vague de sentiment nationaliste à l'encontre de l'élitisme et de la mondialisation lui a donné le plus improbable des présidents, Donald Trump.\nAlors que ses alliés européens et asiatiques craignent à la fois l'unilatéralisme américain et son retrait des institutions libérales occidentales, Les États-Unis parviendront-ils à trouver l'équilibre qui fera triompher l'ordre mondial occidental ?"
 ENG_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Le Royaume-Uni est dans une position qu'aucun pays n'a connu auparavant. Le référendum de 2016 sur le Brexit est passé à une majorité de moins de 52 pourcents et a fait du royaume le premier pays a avoir invoqué l'Article 50 de l'Union Européenne. Cela restera dans l'histoire soit comme la meilleure des décisions pour le peuple britannique, soit comme le pire des choix.\nAccord ou pas d'accord est maintenant la plus grande des questions."
 FRA_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Un centre mondial d'art, de culture et de diplomatie, la France regarde avec enthousiasme ce nouveau siècle débordant d'espoir et d'opportunités. La tyrannie des vieilles monarchies et la destruction des guerres mondiales ont poussé la France vers l'Union Européenne, dont elle est un membre fondateur. \n\nSeul le temps dira comment les français aborderont le siècle à venir."
 GER_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Grâce à l'austérité et aux réformes, l'économie allemande est sortie indemne des deux chocs de la crise financière de 2008 et de la crise européenne de la dette. Étant de loin la plus puissante économie d'Europe, c'est désormais à la prudente et réticente Allemagne de guider l'Union Européenne face au Brexit et aux appels montants de souveraineté nationale. Pour l'Allemagne, l'existence de la Zone Euro et de l'Union Européenne n'est pas un choix, mais une nécessité. L'intégration européenne a crée un marché commun assez large pour ses marchandises, alors que le secteur industriel allemand a depuis longtemps dépassé sa demande intérieure. Par ailleurs, avec une tendance démographique à la baisse, l'Allemagne doit se reposer sur une immigration plus importante pour combler le vide - un choix assurément controversé alors que le nationalisme monte."
 JAP_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Le Japon est l'une des plus grandes économies du monde. Il continue de surpasser nombre de pays européens tout en entretenant une des cultures les plus uniques au monde. Cependant, cette économie est rongée par une dette immense, environnant deux-cent quarante-neuf pourcents de son PIB. Qui plus-est, ces aussu l'un des rares pays souffrant d'une pyramide démographique inversée, où la majorité de sa population a bien plus de quarante ans.\nLe Japon s'effondrera-t-il sous sa dette financière et sa crise démographique, ou passera-t-il l'épreuve du temps pour devenir l'un des plus puissants pays du monde ?"
 SOV_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "La chute de l'Union Soviétique a anéanti 300 ans d'expansionnisme russe, et a renvoyée la nouvelle fédération à ses frontières du 17ème siècle. L'extension de l'OTAN en Europe de l'Est et dans les États post-communistes a laissée la Russie vulnérable, car le coeur du pays se trouve dans la plaine européenne, qui est indéfendable. Aussi, obtenir un contrôle indirect sur des pays post-soviétiques tels que l'Ukraine, la Géorgie et les états baltes à travers des initiatives telles que l'Union Eurasiatique est primordial si la Russie veut être plus qu'une puissance régionale avec une bonne armée. Économiquement, elle doit surpasser le double choc des bas prix du pétrole et des sanctions occidentales, tout en combattant la corruption endémique de sa bureaucratie hautement centralisée."
 CHI_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "La géographie de la Chine - qui est entourée de montagnes et de jungles - la protège, mais l'isole aussi du reste du monde. En tant qu'empire multi-ethnique comptant de larges minorités, rien que maintenir son intégrité territoriale demande des efforts considérables, puisqu'elle doit investir massivement dns son arrière pays et ses territoires disputés afin de maintenir son emprise. Cependant ce qui est peut-être sa plus grande vulnérabilité, c'est sa dépendance aux exportations et au commerce via les océans, qui sont contrôlés par les États-Unis et leurs alliés de l'Asie-Pacifique. Pour que la Chine devienne une vraie superpuissance, elle doit pouvoir rivaliser avec l'US Navy en taille et qualité et faire de ses rivaux asiatiques actuels des alliés. La diplomatie de la Chine est entravée par son absence de système politique attrayant. Cependant, elle est renforcée par ses immense réserves de change et sa propension à les investir à l'étranger."
 BRA_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Au tournant du siècle, le Brésil connaît une ascension lente. Le pays a un potentiel de grandeur. Il est une des plus grandes économies émergentes du monde et sa croissance n'a cessé de s'accélérer. Cependant ces dernières années, la dynamique de l'économie brésilienne reste en rémission après la violente récession qui suivit la crise financière asiatique de 1995, et en raison d'une monnaie paralysée. Un nouveau concurrent est désormais dans l'arène : le PT (Parti des Travailleurs) gagne en popularité.\n\nSerez-vous capable de relancer l'autrefois florissante économie du pays, ou est-ce que le PT et ses politiques socialistes prendra le pouvoir ?"
 UKR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "L'année 2014 a fait de l'Ukraine l'épicentre d'événements qui pourraient à tout moment avoir des conséquences irréversibles. La révolution de Maïdan a renversé le pouvoir autoritaire de Viktor Yanukovich et accouché d'un nouveau gouvernement pro-Occident dirigé par Petro Poroshenko. Malgré de grandes promesses, le dirigeant nouvellement élu a mené le pays dans un gouffre de dette plus large encore et a pris avantage de la situation pour son propre profit. La patience du peuple a des limites. La péninsule de Crimée a été annexée par nos anciens amis, et les régions orientales du Donbass sont ravagées par la guerre. Il reste quelques années avant les nouvelles élections, mais le peuple le supportera-t-il jusqu'à la fin du mandat présidentiel ?"
 TUR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Les dernière années n'ont pas été clémentes. Bien que la menace du PKK ait été presque éliminée, nous ne sommes pas parvenus à l'achever. Cela fait quelques mois que la tentative de Coup d'État a été repoussée, et bien que certains commencent à l'oublier, des conspirateurs sont toujours en liberté, peu d'entre aux sont encore dans notre pays, cachés à l'étranger ou abrités par nos ennemis, y compris la tête du serpent : Fethullah Gülen. Certains cercles ont fait circuler la rumeur qu'Erdogan lui-même aurait organisé le Coup et l'ait fait échoué afin de se débarasser de l'opposition et d'accroître son pouvoir. Malheureusement, il s'est avéré qu'une partie des individus purgés se sont révélés innocents, et l'existence ces codamnations erronées est prouvée."
 ISR_2000_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "D'une certaine manière, Israël n'a jamais été dans une meilleure position. La menace existentielle que posaient ses voisins arabes s'est largement estompée grâce à la normalisation des relations avec l'Égypte et la Jordanie. De grands pas ont été faits vers la résolution de la question palestinienne à travers les Accords d'Oslo de 1993.\n\nMais Israël reste inquète. Le terrorisme et les états-voyous justifient la sécurisation continue du pays, alors que des interrogations à propos de la trajectoire future de l'État Juif continuent de dominer la sphère politique israëlienne. Comment Israël réagira aux pressions croissantes venant de la communauté internationale, des palestiniens, et de son propre peuple reste incertain."
 ISR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "With the oncoming departure of President Obama, Israel is hopeful for a return to the status quo in the Middle East. Recent years have seen Israel threatened by America's pivot to Asia, widespread instability following the Arab Spring, and a resurgent Iran. Many in the Israeli government hope that the new President will revitalize America's commitment to Israeli defence and put an end to efforts to reintegrate Iran into the international community.\n\nBut regardless of the US's position towards Israel and the Middle East at large, deep structural tensions within Israel and the wider region remain, ones that will not be resolved simply by relying on America's unwavering support."
 SYR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "With divided loyalties in the Syrian Armed Forces and staggering losses from 6 years of fighting a brutal civil war, the regular Army is a spent force. Its place on the Syrian battlefield has been taken by wide array of militias, private military companies, Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, who together have begun to reverse Assad's losses. However, with its economy destroyed, and most of Syria's territory under the control of terrorists, rebels and Kurds, the prospect of a united Syria looks certain to be a long struggle ahead."
 SYR_2000_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Syria has been under the dictatorship of the al-Assad family since 1971. Hafez al-Assad's health is currently failing, and soon a new successor will rise. Many of Hafez's children and relatives are vying for power but only one can rule."
 FSA_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Initially the Free Syrian Army was a umbrella-organization of anti-Assad rebel groups and a true government in parallel. However, radicalization of Syrian militants led to mass defections to both Al-Qaeda ally Al-Nusra and ISIS, contributing to the eradication of the FSA in the north of Syria. As a result, the Free Syrian Army was dismantled as an organization. However, a wide array of Muslim Brotherhood linked rebel groups together with smatterings of Salafists and secular groups still retain the label. In the South of Syria, FSA-affiliated groups have been successful in desert warfare against ISIS, and still defend most of Dara'a from Assad's forces. In the north, the Turkish Army intervention has been successful in creating a wedge between the two Kurdish cantons."
 NUS_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "In January of 2017 multiple Mujahideen factions united under the call to a unified Jihad against the tyrant Al-Assad. Known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or the Levant Liberation Committee, this formidable organization was formed in the bloodshed of the Syrian civil war. The group is classified by the U.S.A as a terrorist organization and an al-Qaeda affiliated organization."
 ROJ_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "As the Syrian Civil War began, Assad's forces withdrew from the Kurdish areas to defend its heartland. This allowed the long repressed Kurdish people, through the left-wing Democratic Union Party and it's militia, the YPG, to take control and establish Rojava, based on democratic socialism and gender equality. As ISIS entered the Syrian battlefield, they targeted the Kurds with force, taking over large swaths of Rojava, culminating in the failed assault on Kobane. With reinforcements from the Peshmerga, the Turkish PKK and US air support, the Kurds were able to turn the tide and send ISIS on the run. Since then, it has incorporated parts of the old FSA under the banner of the \"SDF\". However, it's future challenges remain numerous, with Turkey repeatedly threatening war and fears looming that the tacit alliance with Assad might break down into conflict."
 OTHER_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 DEN_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Denmark is a safe and secure nation, being both a member of the EU and NATO. However, an internal economic downturn and slowdown has recently begun challenging the Danish state. Whether Denmark can continue to remain immune from the turbulence of the wider world is far from certain."
 ETH_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Ethiopia's monarchy was overthrown in 1974 and its subsequent communist dictatorship in 1991. The constitution of 1995 has provided a somewhat stable democracy, but it has failed to address the problems of starvation, political crisis and corruption."
 FIN_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Ever concerned with preserving its neutrality, Finland has carefully watched the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent political expansion of the western European integrationist project. The Finns joined the EU in 1995 and has also adopted the Euro as the national currency. Can peace last? Are the Russians truly pacified?"
 ITA_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Italy has been ever so slightly behind the other Great Powers since the beginning of the 20th Century. After its defeat in World War Two, Italy's strong bond to its former enemies and its former ally in Germany has brought it back up to the status of a highly developed and prosperous country. But what will the future hold? National greatness or economic disaster?"
 GRE_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Greece is in turmoil following the 2008 recession which further weakened its already fragile economy. The increasing debt to GDP ratio combined with tensions due to the rise of radical parties makes Greece's condition worsen by the day. Furthermore, Greece and Turkey still have sour relations, meaning that any minor incident could potentially drive the two countries towards war.\n\nGreece finds itself teetering on the edge of collapse, with even the smallest decision potentially making or breaking the country. Let us hope you make the right choices."
 NOR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Norway voted against joining the European Union in 1995 and has subsequently stayed distant from Europe to a certain extent. Nonetheless, the country remains a NATO member and shares a short but critical border with the Russian Federation, a powerful neighbor that it must necessarily be wary of."
 SWE_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Sweden had been in a deep economic crisis in the early 1990s, with the country's EU accession in 1995 doing little to alleviate its issues. The Swedish nation, which stays militarily neutral as is Swedish tradition, has to find economic answers to its current troubles."
 POL_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Poland has grown massively since its arrival to the European Union in 2004. It is now a regional power and one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. It is on course to become one of the most significant powers in Europe. Poland's current political situation is an interesting one as PiS has gotten into power and relations with the EU have gotten heated. A staunchly anti-Russian country, Poland has made a large effort into strengthening its relations with the United States."
 SWI_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Neutral since time immemorial, Switzerland has decided to stay out of both NATO and the European Union. Can the international community still rely on Switzerland to be the silent judge and the neutral ground it has always been? Or will the Swiss people see their government take a more active role abroad to preserve peace and enforce Swiss national interests?"
 BRM_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Aung Saan Suu Kyi, once the darling of the international community, has seen a dramatic reversal of fortunes in terms of international public opinion. No longer the charismatic and eloquent human rights campaigner, the Rohingya Crisis has transformed Myanmar's de facto leader into a vilified war criminal in the eyes of many. Within the country's territorial boundaries, rebel groups and still powerful military generals watch for signs of weakness. These twin dilemmas, international and domestic, present the government of Myanmar with important choices. Permit or halt the violence against the Muslims of Rakhine. Attempt to restore relations with the West, or fall back on the military junta's old ally, China. The answer is far from clear."
 NIG_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Nigeria's last ten years have shown the true colors of the Islamic State as it supports the major uprising of Boko Haram and the Salafist rebels in the North East of Nigeria. The military of Nigeria proved incredibly ineffective at fighting in the new kind of guerilla warfare. It has slowly grown into a major regional conflict as the Nigerian government is slowly losing more and more control over of the state of Borno.\n Will you end the insurgency or join the global jihad?"
 BHR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Bahrain is a nation that did not escape the wave of protests that spread throughout the Middle East as part of the so-called \"Arab Spring\". The Day of Rage saw the Shi'a majority vent its frustration against a monarchy that is perceived not only as discriminatory towards the Shi'a but also as a foreign occupier and an oppressor of the true, indigenous Bahraini people. Without the intervention of Peninsula Shield, the monarchy may well have collapsed in 2011.\n\nThe Khalifa dynasty's priority is therefore the preservation of its rule in the face of Shi'a hostility. While historically the Sunni opposition posed a greater threat, the specter of Iranian influence and limited political liberalization mean that this threat has been subdued, at least for now."
 KUW_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Kuwait enjoys a relatively comfortable position internationally. The greatest threat to its sovereignty, Saddam Hussein's Iraq, was eliminated by the American invasion of 2003, and Kuwait has managed to maintain good relations with all of the Middle East's regional players.\n\nKuwait's biggest challenge, although not an urgent one, is internal in nature. The country's system of semi-democratic rule has bolstered the government's legitimacy but has prevented the reforms necessary to diversify Kuwait's oil-dependent economy. Moreover, Kuwait's reforms have not completely placated the opposition, who continue to oppose government censorship and the occasional repression of political activists."
 OMA_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Oman has earned a reputation as a beacon of peace and stability in a restless and conflict-prone region. Qaboos bin Said al Said has pursued a successful foreign policy since he took power in 1970, leading a country that is hated by none and admired by all. But Oman is not without its challenges. The Sultan has been criticized for his heavy-handed approach towards internal dissent, raising uncertainty about the sustainability of the absolute monarchy. Moreover, the war in Yemen has opened up a new threat. Oman has historically considered the Yemeni province of al-Mahra part of its sphere of influence, given the region's close cultural links to Dhofar in Oman. But the presence of Saudi troops threatens Oman's border and will not be tolerated by the Omani state, even if it means secretly undermining the Saudi war effort."
 QAT_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Since 1996 Qatar has charted an independent course within the Gulf Cooperation Council. The country's natural gas reserves has allowed Qatar to operate outside of the Saudi-dominated oil market, and for decades the emirs of Qatar have enjoyed a close relationship to the populist Muslim Brotherhood, an organization that the Saudis and Emiratis have increasingly come to see as a threat to their authority. As the home of Al-Jazeera, Qatar is partially blamed by the other Arab autocracies for the spread of the Arab uprisings collectively known as the Arab Spring. Worst of all in the eyes of the Saudis and their Emirati allies is Qatar's close relationship with Iran, a state that they view as an existential threat. It is only a matter of time before the hostility of Qatar's neighbors to its unique foreign policy reaches boiling point."
 SAU_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "The Saudis have watched as the Middle East was irrevocably transformed by a series of momentous events. First the events of 2003 eliminated a major player in the power struggle between Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran and inflamed sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shi'a as a result of the subsequent civil war. Then the Saudis watched in horror as friendly regimes across the Arab world were toppled by the phenomenon known as the Arab Spring. And finally, the Saudis anxiously observed America's gradual withdrawal from the region and its rapprochement with Iran under Obama. All this has convinced the Saudis of the need for a more proactive foreign policy, one that has led the monarchy to aggressively counter Iranian influence across the Middle East. From Lebanon to Yemen, from Syria to Iraq, battle lines are being drawn."
 UAE_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Fondly nicknamed by American officials as \"Little Sparta\", the United Arab Emirates has been a close ally to both the United States and Saudi Arabia and an eager participant in multilateral military operations. The Emirati armed forces, particularly its reputable air force and its elite Presidential Guard, has seen service in Afghanistan, Libya, Kosovo, Somalia and now Yemen. But the UAE is not content to simply play second fiddle to the US or Saudi Arabia. The Emiratis have punched above their weight in terms of foreign influence, at times competing with its erstwhile allies for example by throwing its weight behind separatists in Yemen temporarily allied to the Saudi-backed Hadi government. Moreover, the UAE is home to the only successful case of economic diversification, Dubai having earned a reputation as a global city and a financial hub."
 CAN_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Having gained complete independence from the UK in 1982, Canada is the 4th largest exporter of oil in the world and has proven to be one of the leading countries in counter-terror operations. With the second largest landmass in the world, Canada is made up of mostly ice plains and mountains with the majority of the population residing in the south of the country. With a vast amount of resources at its disposal, Canada is a country with endless possibility and potential."
 KOR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Korea is in the midst of one of the most dramatic presidential scandals in its history. Following massive demonstrations, conservative President Park Geun-hye has just been impeached by the National Assembly due to the shadowy influence of her Rasputin-esque advisor, Choi Soon-sil. With the ruling party in chaos and fresh elections likely to be called in a few months, the stage seems set for the left-wing Democratic Party to make a return to power.\n\nIf presidential hopeful Moon Jae-in makes it to the Blue House, he will need to restore faith in the Korean political system, achieve an ambitious economic agenda, and manage what are likely to be tense relations between the US and North Korea following the US presidential election."
 NKO_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Many underestimated the young, portly Kim Jong-un when the time came for him to assume his father's position as Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic. It has since become clear that this Swiss-educated, poorly-understood figure was a force to be reckoned with. His brutal consolidation of power featured the execution of Kim's uncle and a host of other officials including, if reports are to be believed, one execution by anti-aircraft cannon. But the young Kim's position is not entirely secure. Dissent within the ranks of the establishment remain, and his ambitious economic reform agenda is still gathering steam. Will the latest iteration of the North's Kim Dynasty sustain the state as his father and grandfather did? Or will he witness the collapse of his kingdom?"
 BOT_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Botswana is one of the most highly developed countries in Africa with a stable democracy, high human development index and low corruption. Botswana gained its wealth after large amounts of diamonds were found, which lead to one of the highest GDP per capita in Africa. However, it is not without its problems; the politics are dominated by the BDP party, whom many see as autocratic and uninclusive. In addition, poaching is rampant in the country's many game reserves. Diamonds are also not going to last forever, and a solution needs to be found to find alternatives for the economy."
 AFG_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "With the help of coalition forces, the Northern Alliance successfully toppled the Taliban regime. Instead of being annihilated, the Taliban have since fragmented and begun waging an insurgency in various parts of Afghanistan, they still pose a significant threat to coalition and government forces. While some actions of the coalition forces are reasons for the Taliban's growth, the inefficiency and corruption of the central government and Afghanistan's unique pre-modern tribal culture are the main reasons why the Taliban are difficult to annihilate, not to mention the fact that Taliban militants can hide and regroup in parts of Pakistan and go return to the fight in Afghanistan. Will government forces end the Taliban insurgency? Or will there be a peace deal to convince the Taliban to peacefully lay down their arms and join the government?"

 MILLENNIUM_DAWN: "Millennium Dawn"
 MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The world has changed. Globally speaking, an atmosphere of peace and prosperity has ruled for about half a century. But with the recent end of the Cold War and the rise of the People's Republic of China, how will this world see itself? How will it shape itself? Will the United States continue its dominance? Will the new Russian Federation find its way into the spotlight? What roles will the former great European empires of Britain, France and Germany play? And what role will the shadow of terrorism have? The world has changed. The world is changing."
 CHI_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The backwater of yesterday. The superpower of tomorrow. After decades of European bullying and even more decades of civil war, strife, and invasion by the Japanese, China looks to rebuild itself as the foremost power of Asia, and eventually, the world. \n\nUnder the leadership of the Communist Party, great strides have been made in building a new China. But this new China is volatile. If China reforms too slowly; it may be destroyed. If it reforms too quickly; it might destroy itself."
 FRA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "A global center of art, culture, and diplomacy, France looks brightly upon a new century brimming with hope and opportunity. The tyranny of the ancient monarchies and the destruction of the World Wars have hurtled France towards the European Union, of which it is a founding member. \n\nOnly time will tell how the French will tackle the century ahead."
 GER_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The retreat of the Soviets and the reunification of East and West Germany have given new hope to the nation. Germany’s traumatic past and the horrors of fascism have not been lost on the general populace. Now, Germany stands as one of the most democratic nations in Europe, with a robust social welfare system and one of the strongest economies in Europe. \n\nA founding member of the European Union, Germany looks towards expanding the bloc to include the former Soviet states of Eastern Europe against a possible Russian resurgence."
 JAP_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "A land of roughly 6,852 islands, the maritime people of Japan have come far since the Second World War and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Today, Japan stands as the second-largest economy on Earth, renowned for its technological innovation and quality products shipped across the world. \n\nBacked by its American and European allies, Japan looks warily at its old rival China with both newfound confidence and new potential for conflict."
 SOV_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The August Coup and subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 has left the Russian economy in tatters, its pride shaken, and its future looking grim. Oligarchs and corrupt officials have filled the vacuum of power in the absence of a strong central authority. \n\nThe recent rise of Vladimir Putin has many wondering how this ex-KGB officer will attempt to restore Russia’s legacy and bring it forward into a new age."
 ENG_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "With Hong Kong handed over to China in 1997, the United Kingdom has bid farewell to its last great colonial possession. The once mightiest nation on Earth is desperately trying to redefine itself and find a new path to greatness and glory. \n\nWill that path lie in continued cooperation with the United States? Should Britain draw closer to its European brethren? Or shall Britannia, on her own, rule the waves once more?"
 USA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The collapse of the Soviet Union has led to the world’s first unipolar moment. The United States stands at the forefront of all technological, military, and cultural forces at work across the globe. Its reach has never been greater, and its future has never looked brighter. \n\nThe upcoming elections will prove a crucial moment in determining the future course of America; and for better or worse, the world."
 TUR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War One, Turkey has largely remained in the backdrop of geopolitical affairs. Now, Turkey’s position puts it in the spotlight once again, as competing ideologies work to shift the country one way or the other. \n\nShould the Republic continue with Atatürk's reforms and seek recognition with the EU, or remain true to its Islamic heritage? The failing health of Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit signals uncertain times ahead."
 UKR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The elections of 1999 were supposed to bring an unconditional victory to the liberal leader of the National Movement - Viacheslav Chornovil. But soon, he died in a car accident under mysterious circumstances. The current president, Leonid Kuchma, won the election in the wake of truthful slogans and lack of populist promises. But what his cadence will bring is still questionable. \n\nAfter being deprived of its nuclear status in 1996 and signing the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine received guarantees of protection from the strongest states and a ticket to the world theater. But who will the young country be at the future performance? A direct participant or merely an observer in the last rows?"
 BRA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Brazil is slowly on the rise at the turn of the century. The country has the potential for greatness. It is one of the world's largest emerging economies and its growth has continued to accelerate. However, in recent years Brazil's economic current is reeling back from a harsh recession due to the Asian Financial Crisis of 1995 and a crippled currency. Now a new party contender has arrived on the scene. The PT has swapped in and is quickly gaining traction.\n\nWill you be able to kickstart the country's once great economy or will the PT and its socialist policies seize hold?"

 GRE_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "As the 21st century dawns upon Greece the country seems content. However, under the surface there are growing concerns over the debt crisis and the rise of radical political parites on both sides of the spectrum. The future of the Hellenic Republic is uncertain, and unless it is properly guided it could go down a dark path."
 ICE_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "In a hidden corner of Europe, Iceland has successfully kept a low profile since independence in 1944. Political conflicts with the British about fishing rights were perhaps the most exciting time in Icelandic history. Should Iceland take a more central stance?"

 RAJ_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Where China is the superpower of tomorrow, India is the superpower of next week.

 SPR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Since Franco's death in 1975, Spain has been on a long path of recovery. Through economic and social hardship, the country managed to partially work through the issues that decades of falangism had caused. Spain joined NATO (1982) and the EU (1986) and has tirelessly and under the greatest of efforts worked to catch up to the more powerful and wealthy major countries of Europe; to Germany, France, Britain, and Italy.\nIn times like these, Spain requires strong leadership and a stable hand. Can Prime Minister Aznar deliver? Or will his Partido Popular make place for a more worthy leadership?"
 SWE_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Sweden had been in a deep economic crisis in the early 1990s, with the country's EU accession in 1995 doing little to alleviate its issues. The Swedish nation, which stays militarily neutral as is Swedish tradition, has to find economic answers to its current troubles."
 SWI_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Neutral since time immemorial, Switzerland has decided to stay out of not only NATO and the European Union, but also even the United Nations. Can the international community still rely on Switzerland to be the silent judge and the neutral ground it has always been? Or will the Swiss people see their government take a more active role abroad to preserve peace and enforce Swiss national interests?"
 BRM_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Myanmar stands at a crossroads at the start of the 21st century. The military junta has come to realize that its grip on power is steadily loosening, as pressure from both within and without to democratize grows ever stronger. However, democratization or lack thereof is not the only issue before Myanmar's government. The territorial integrity of this Southeast Asian nation has been shaky ever since independence, with rebel groups fighting for greater autonomy plaguing Myanmar's border regions. The solutions to these twin dilemmas remain unclear. Violence or diplomacy? Democracy or authoritarianism? Compromise or revolution? Only time will tell."
 POL_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Poland has recently broken free from the communist bloc of the Soviet Union. The current situation in the country is far from perfect. Despite the growth of the Polish economy since the fall of communism, the people of Poland continue to struggle. Despite these difficulties, the nation itself has a lot of potential to become a significant economic power. The future looks bright for Poland."
 NIG_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Nigeria at the turn of the century has slowly gained international primacy as its large population and bankers continue to expand their hold in foreign markets. Furthermore, they have begun to participate more in the local region as their newfound liberal democracy has started to grow in popularity. However, Nigerian democracy is now strained by the emergence of Sharia Law in its northern states, threatening the stability of the nation. Outrage and protests have exploded amongst the Christian populace. \nWill the growing popularity of Islam cause war in the country?"
 BHR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The newly crowned emir of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, inherits a precarious position. Bahrain's Shi'a majority harbors significant frustration towards a monarchy that is perceived not only as discriminatory towards the Shi'a but also as a foreign occupier and an oppressor of the true, indigenous Bahraini people. The Sunni opposition, for albeit different reasons, resents the autocratic nature of Bahraini government, and has aligned itself with Shi'a groups opposed to a continuation of the absolute monarchy. Some of the emir's advisors have pushed for political liberalization as a way to reduce the pressure placed on the regime, while others have advocated a strengthening of autocratic rule. It will be up to Bahrain's new ruler to chart a course for the country."
 KUW_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Not too long ago Kuwait was a country under occupation. Its monarchy was in exile campaigning for a restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty, while the people of Kuwait, both Sunni and Shi'a, were united against the Iraqi oppressor. Now that the Gulf War has restored Kuwaiti independence, the monarchy must resume the political balancing act that is ruling the nation of Kuwait. Kuwait's parliament, one of the most powerful in the Middle East, places a powerful check on the monarch's authority while continually pressing for greater political liberalization. The country's influential merchant class continues to push for greater investment in the private sector, something that public sector-employed Kuwaiti citizens are reluctant to see happen at the expense of their own welfare."
 OMA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Oman has earned a reputation as a beacon of peace and stability in a restless and conflict-prone region. Qaboos bin Said al Said has pursued a successful foreign policy since he took power in 1970, leading a country that is hated by none and admired by all. But Oman is not without its challenges. The Sultan has been criticized for his heavy-handed approach towards internal dissent, raising uncertainty about the sustainability of the absolute monarchy."
 QAT_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Since 1996 Qatar has charted an independent course within the Gulf Cooperation Council. The country's natural gas reserves has allowed Qatar to operate outside of the Saudi-dominated oil market, and for decades the emirs of Qatar have enjoyed a close relationship to the populist Muslim Brotherhood, an organization that the Saudis and Emiratis have increasingly come to see as a threat to their authority. Worst of all in the eyes of the Saudis and their Emirati allies is Qatar's close relationship with Iran, a state that they view as an existential threat. It is only a matter of time before the hostility of Qatar's neighbors to its unique foreign policy reaches boiling point."
 SAU_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Saudi Arabia has historically enjoyed a comfortable position as one of the Middle East's leading powers. As custodian of the holy sites of Mecca and Medina, the Kingdom enjoys unparalleled religious legitimacy. However, the Iranian Revolution of 1979 transformed mutual Saudi-Iranian suspicion into outright hostility as the newly formed Islamic Republic of Iran sought to claim the mantle of leader of the Islamic world. Internally too the Kingdom faces challengers for the title of leader of the Islamic world. Since the Saudis allowed American troops into the country in 1991, the al-Qaeda leadership has sworn to destroy the Saudi monarchy and its false piety and replace it with a truly Islamic government."
 UAE_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Fondly nicknamed by American officials as \"Little Sparta\", the United Arab Emirates has been a close ally to both the United States and Saudi Arabia and an eager participant in multilateral military operations. The Emirati armed forces, particularly its reputable air force and its elite Presidential Guard, has seen service in the Gulf War, accumulating useful military experience.\n\nBut the UAE is not content to simply play second fiddle to the US or Saudi Arabia. The Emiratis have punched above their weight in terms of foreign influence, at times competing with its erstwhile allies. Moreover, the UAE is home to the only successful case of economic diversification, Dubai having earned a reputation as a global city and a financial hub."
 KOR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The Republic of Korea has successfully overcome war, poverty, and dictatorship to become one of the most developed and stable countries in the world. President Kim Dae-jung is widely respected for his role in bringing democracy to Korea and many are hopeful about his efforts to make peace with the North.\n\nHowever, his administration has been tainted by scandal and Korean politics remains exceedingly polarized. Political partisanship, government corruption, and uncertainty surrounding the president's efforts to reconcile with the North will define Korea's future in this new millennium."
 NKO_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The so-called \"Hermit Kingdom\" is a place that the outside world perceives as mysterious and threatening in equal measure. Rumblings of a secret nuclear program in the country are proliferating and its southern neighbor remains suspicious of the North's intentions. But cracks have started showing in the Hermit Kingdom's impenetrable image. Still in the process of recovering from a devastating famine known as the Arduous March, the DPRK has had to rely on external assistance to help weather the storm. The weaknesses of the North's system of governance are patently clear. Will Kim Jong-il address these shortcomings, and adopt a diplomatic approach to the outside world to facilitate development? Or will he decide that the bellicosity of the army and the ideological fervor of the party must be sustained by war?"
 BOT_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Botswana is one of the most highly developed countries in Africa with a stable democracy, high human development index and low corruption. Botswana gained its wealth after large amounts of diamonds were found, which lead to one of the highest GDP per capita in Africa. However, it is not without its problems; the politics are dominated by the BDP party, whom many see as autocratic and uninclusive. In addition, poaching is rampant in the country's many game reserves. Diamonds are also not going to last forever, and a solution needs to be found to find alternatives for the economy."
 AFG_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Since the communists took power in 1978, Afghanistan has been in a cycle of civil war and external intervention. The 1989 withdrawal of the Soviet Union and the subsequent fall of the regime in 1992 did not bring peace. Rather, the conflict of interests between the Mujahideen factions led to continued fighting until 1996, when the Pakistani-backed Taliban took advantage of the civil war to seize large parts of Afghanistan. Their goal was to eliminate all other factions, forcing the former warlords to form the Northern Alliance against the Taliban under the mediation of General Massoud. What does the future hold for this war-torn country?"
 OTHER_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan. The wars of the past have left the nations of the present fearing for the future. However, there is great hope that humanity might have passed 20 centuries of bloodshed to complete its transition to a period of peace and stability."
