 MEX_sedena: "SEDENA"
 MEX_sedena_desc: "Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA) is the government department responsible for ensuring Mexico's sovereignty from external threats. As it stands, SEDENA is constantly getting inflicted by massive cuts from every corner, as Mexicans don't feel threatened by an outside force. However, it's up to us to change the course if we wished to."
 MEX_mexican_army: "The Mexican Army"
 MEX_mexican_army_desc: "In Theory, the Mexican army, like any other, is essential in preserving our presence to others. However, most of the time tends to hold a more pragmatic role within our borders, like helping our citizens in national disasters. Regardless of Mexico's current state, there is always a chance for a threat to appear that will force us to a battlefield. We need to be ready beforehand for such a disaster."
 MEX_mexican_navy: "The Mexican Navy"
 MEX_mexican_navy_desc: "The Mexican Navy, out of all branches of our military, is by far the most underdeveloped. For over a century, concepts of a Grand navy were deemed outdated and unimportant by Mexicans. Instead, more emphasis was put on guarding coastal territories while maintaining a cheaper alternative. Despite our past decisions, we could always change our stance and start developing a sizable and sturdy navy!"
 MEX_mexican_air_force: "The Mexican Air Force"
 MEX_mexican_air_force_desc: "The Mexican airforce consists of light aircraft, attack helicopters, and their representative logistical variants. It is mainly used for internal affairs and helping against the cartels. However, in the face of an external threat, we wouldn't stand a chance, as we lack any meaningful impact. Committing to an increased budget will ensure our strength to repel such force back from where it came."
