 SYR_assad_day_desc:0 "The Assad family has ruled Syria for decades. The victory in the civil war has only semented their position. As we celebrate victory, we will hold meetings with our allies Russia and Iran. Since they played such a big role in the victory, they will most likely try to heavily influence our politics. We should be careful not to go against their wishes too many times."
 SYR_incorporate_ssnp:0 "Incorporate SSNP"
 SYR_incorporate_ssnp_desc:0 "The Syrian Social Nationalist Party, or the SSNP, is a party which aims for the creation of Greater Syria.

 SYR_ssnp_traitors:0 "The Traitors of SSNP" 
 SYR_ssnp_traitors_desc:0 "The Syrian Social Nationalist Party left the Ba'athist led National Progressive Front to join the opposition, only to come back to support us with their tail between their legs.

 SYR_ssnp_coup:0 "SSNP Coup"
 SYR_ssnp_coup_desc:0 "With enough support, the SSNP could secure the dominant position in the National Progressive Front. It can be dangerous though, and can throw the country into chaos again. The more popular the SSNP, the more likely the coup is."
 SYR_integrate_palestinians:0 "Integrate Palestinian Militias"
 SYR_integrate_palestinians_desc:0 "Syria is a home to a large population of Palestinians. During the civil war, many Palestinian militias fought on the side of Assad, due to Syria's support for Palestinian freedom. Keeping these groups around will increase our firepower, but since they are quasi-independent, it'll be harder to operate them with our regular army."
 SYR_expel_palestinians:0 "Expel Palestinians"
 SYR_expel_palestinians_desc:0 "The Palestinian groups helped us win the civil war. However, keeping ragtag militias around is dangereous to our nation.

 SYR_formalise_shia_militias:0 "Formalise Shia Militias"
 SYR_formalise_shia_militias_desc:0 "Many Shia militias support the Assad regime during the civil war. Integrating them into the Syrian Arab Army will help us bolster our ranks. However, many of the Shia groups are funded and supported by Iran, making it dangereous to give them more power."
 SYR_disarm_militias:0 "Disarm Militias"
 SYR_disarm_militias_desc:0 "The Shia militias fought bravely on our side during the war.

 SYR_russian_tool:0 "Tool of Russia"
 SYR_russian_tool_desc:0 "Russia has been operating in Syria from their base in Latakia. They have been a great help to us, and they could be a valuable ally in the future.

 SYR_iranian_puppet_desc:0 "Iran has been one of our biggest supplier of weapons and militias during the war, and have been a strong ally for decades. They are the best option we have to rebuild Syria. Of course, surrendering to them will surely put us on their leash for years to come."

 SyriaFocus.0.t:0 "The Status of Rojava"
 SyriaFocus.0.desc:0 "The Rojava are a Kurdish dominated self-governing area in northern Syria. During the civil war, they fought mainly against ISIS with other secular and progressive militias and factions. Their end goal was to create a federal Syrian republic, though many see the area just as Western Kurdistan. Demanding that they submit to us will most likely lead into a civil war. We could always offer them limited autonomy, though this means we won't be able to fully control them. Letting them go might increase Kurdish nationalism in the area."

 SyriaFocus.6.desc:0 "During the Syrian Civil War, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP for short) first switched sides against the regime, but eventually realigned themselves with Assad. Their militias were a keyfactor in Assad's victory, and they have been gaining popularity as a political party as well. Keeping them around will ensure their militias are at Assad's service, but this will increase their influence. Purging them might lead to resistance from them later on./n/nHow should we advise Assad?"

[Root.GetLeader] lowers his hand and walks towards the formation. He starts shaking the hands of each soldier in the first row. One by one, he greets the soldiers, and onlookers can see the pride in their faces. One particular soldier catches the eye of [Root.GetLeader]. As he shakes the hand of the soldier, it seems as if the soldier is saying something to him. An expression of horror appears on the face of [Root.GetLeader]. Merely a moment later the explosives hidden inside the soldier's jacket explode.\n\nDozens of fighters wearing the symbols of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party emerge from hiding, and start firing on the soldiers and the crowd. The Syrian security forces quickly take control of the situation and neutralise the hostiles.\n\nThe mangled body of [Root.GetLeader] is found only a few feet away from the point of explosion.

 Syria.2.desc:0 "Throughout the Syrian civil war, we've had an uneasy alliance with the Tahrir Al-Sham, also known as the Al-Nusra Front. We have avoided conflict with them, so we could focus on taking out the Assad regime. However, as the dust settles, our forces are starting across the border at theirs.\n\nWe could continue the civil war, and take them out.

 Syria.15.d:0 "With Assads murderous forces advancing deep into Idlib, the hardline islamist coalition of Tahrir al-Sham have suffered irreversible losses and their unity has broken down. As the Free Syrian Army is a wide coalition of groups, we are also welcoming to islamists as long as they commit to our dream of a free Syria. The islamist militias see now the benefits of operating under a more moderate banner as it will allow them to recieve foreign support. This will increase our coordination of offensives and breath new life into our revolution."

Our rival rebel coalition, the Free Syrian Army has essentially collapsed due to large battlefield losses, and most of their remaining militia groups have pledged allegiance to our great islamist coalition as we have been more effective and successful in our jihad against Bashar the godless dog and his Iranian apostate puppetmasters. Years of fighting this brutal civil war has turned most of the former FSA-forces under the sway of islamist ideology. Though we don't exactly agree with the Muslim Brotherhoods interpretation of everything, they are, inshallah, willing to fight together with us in a coordinated fashion, and at least believe in Sharia as the sole law and Islam as the only needed governance of Syria."

After the fall of Assad, the two parties entered negotiations on the future of Syria. Surprisingly, officials of the Free Syrian Army have agreed to give a certain amount of seats in the coming parliament to Tahrir Al-Sham.\n\nMany political analysts predict that this uneasy alliance between the two factions won't be able to survive together for very long"

 SyriaNews.8.t:0 "Syrian Islamists joins with FSA under banner of unity"
 SyriaNews.8.d:0 "With growing military pressure on the Syrian islamists of Tahrir al-Sham, their unity has broken down and their remaining forces have pledged allegiance to the Free Syrian Army Coalition in a last ditch effort to unify the strength of the Syrian rebels to be able to mount an decisive offensive against Assad's forces. It is likely the possibility of recieving foreign military aid played a large role in convincing the islamists to operate under a more moderate banner."

 SyriaNews.9.t:0 "Collapse of the FSA - remaining rebels team up with islamists"
 SyriaNews.9.d:0 "With growing military pressure on the Free Syrian Army Coalition, their already shaky unity has broken completely down and the remaining militias have mostly pledged allegiance to the Syrian islamists of Tahrir al-Sham. Tahrir al-Sham, which has the former al-Qaeda affiliated Nusra-Front at it's core, have been more effective and successful on the battlefield against Assad's forces, and this added with the growing influence of radical ideology within many FSA-groups has made an large scale switch of allegiance increasingly more likely over time."
