 Timor_news.1.t: "Timor-Leste is Free!"
 Timor_news.1.desc: "It is official. The U.N's approval of East Timor's constitution has finally been inacted, and Timor-Leste is officially a sovereign and independent nation as well as a full member state of the United Nations. After decades of struggle and drama with the Indonesian administration and armed forces, two parties came to an agreement, and peace was established."
 Timor_news.1.o1: "Let us hope for good future relations"
 Timor.26.t: "Indonesia Approves of UN Set East Timor Election Date"
 Timor.26.d: "After looking at the UN charter for East Timorese democracy, Indonesia sent them off with their blessing, and East Timor is set to become fully independent on May 20."
 Timor.26.o1: "Onward to democracy"
 Timor.27.t: "The First East Timorese Presidential Election!"

 Timor.27.o2: "Francisco Xavier do Amaral is our hero!"
 Timor.28.t: "Indonesia Denies Us Independence!"
 Timor.28.desc: "The other day, our nation received the equivalent of a death note, Indonesia sent us an ultimatum demanding an unconditional surrender of our sovereignty and the calling away of all international humanitarian missions within our nation, claiming that 'Indonesian territory needs not foreign charity'. Our de-facto split with Indonesia, that some would call 'audacious', was sanctioned by the former Indonesian president Bacharuddin Habibie in an attempt to westernise Indonesia and Australia's John Howard. It seems that the ousting of Habibie followed a radical change regarding Indonesia's stance on our autonomy, and Australia seems to be the only friend we have right now, as well as our only hope..."
 Timor.28.o1: "Outrageous, we call upon Australia to help us!"
 Timor.29.t: "Australia Abandons Us"
 Timor.29.desc: "In response to our desperate call for help to whom we thought was our ally, Australia has dropped support for us and gave up on our democracy. It seems that they have little interest to support a free people pursue independence, and their hypocrisy has left us with very few options. If we stay defiant to Indonesia, a nation much larger than us, we have no doubt that they will use their military to the fullest extent. But if we can hold off for long enough, Indonesia's reckless behaviour will draw international condemnation and they will be forced to back down and we will gain our freedom! On the other hand, many of our people would die in this conflict which begs the question, will there be anything left for us at road's end?..."
 Timor.29.o1: "We don't need any help, we will fight them ourselves!"
 Timor.29.o2: "It is better to spare our people from needless bloodshed"
 Timor.30.t: "East Timor Surrenders Peacefully"
 Timor.30.desc: "It seems that the East Timorese revolutionaries made the wise choice of conceding to our peace treaty and backed down under the pressure of the looming inevitability of another military intervention if they continued with their defiance."
 Timor.30.o1: "We knew they'd come around"
 Timor.31.t: "The War is Over!"

 Timor.37.t: ""
 Timor.37.desc: "Indonesia has insisted on ignoring the international community and will not stop their violent conquest and oppression of the East Timorese people. On one hand, a majority of our people do not want to see the United States get entangled in another affair that doesn't concern us too deeply for it might bring us great pain and suffering as a nation as happened with Vietnam. On the other, we are seen as the international police and protectors of liberty across the world, if we weren't ready on standby to defend all sovereign and free peoples everywhere, what would we be?"
 Timor.37.o1: "They've gone too far"
 Timor.37.o2: "We shouldn't get too involved in everything"
