 subparty_policies.0.desc: "With a swift operation, we managed to secure the funds of a foreign power. By freezing overseas assets, confiscating material and properties and by transferring financial instruments to government accounts we have significantly increase the wealth of our nation."
 subparty_policies.0.a: "Neat."
 subparty_policies.1.t: "State Takes Control of a Foreign Factory"
 subparty_policies.1.desc: "The [ROOT.GetAdjective] leader [ROOT.GetLeader] announced today that the assets of a large company, headquartered outside our country, would be forcefully bought by the state. This is to prevent the 'eventual relocation of industrial output somewhere else' and 'end the exploitation of [ROOT.GetAdjective] workers', as stated by our great leader. To the company in question, this comes as a shock. The CEO was quoted saying that 'it is pure insanity that a state would have authority over an honest and reputable company'."
 subparty_policies.1.a: "Neat."
 subparty_policies.2.t: "State Occupies an Arms Factory"
 subparty_policies.2.desc: "Early this morning, [ROOT.GetAdjective] military police marched onto the property of a military equipment factory operated by an international defence company. The company had been declared in breach of international law, and is under suspicion of delivering weapons for capitalistic wars against humanity. For this reason, all company property has been confiscated by the [Root.GetAdjective] government. All military production at the factory will continue immediately so we can do a full indepth review on how inhumane these weapons are exactly."

A spokesperson of the international shipbuilding company currently leasing and running the dockyard denied the claims saying that the [ROOT.GetAdjective] authorities have in no way been in contact with the company."
 subparty_policies.3.a: "Neat."
 subparty_policies.4.t: "Nationalisation Fails"
 subparty_policies.4.desc: "It seems that our plans to nationalise foreign assets leaked to our target. Before we could react, bank accounts had been closed and money moved to offshore accounts. It is possible that someone in our administration had gotten a bit too friendly with foreign powers, leading to the leak."
 subparty_policies.4.a: "Neat."
 subparty_policies.5.t: "Company Relocates Factories from [ROOT.GetName]"
 subparty_policies.5.desc: "It seems that our plans to nationalise foreign assets leaked to our target. Due to this, an international company made a snap decision to move one of their manufacturing plants out of the country under the fear of losing all their assets. This is a big blow to the [ROOT.GetAdjective] economy."
 subparty_policies.5.a: "That's awful."
 subparty_policies.6.t: "Tech Company Takeover"
