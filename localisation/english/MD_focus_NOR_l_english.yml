 NOR_Kongehuset_idea: "Kongehuset"
 NOR_Kongehuset_idea_desc: "The Norwegian monarchy, a symbol of unity and tradition, continues to play an important role in the nation's identity. However, as the 21st century unfolds, debates over the relevance and cost of the Kongehuset have emerged. While many Norwegians cherish the royal family's cultural significance, others question its place in a rapidly modernizing and egalitarian society. Balancing tradition with contemporary values will be key to maintaining its legitimacy."

 NOR_high_cost_of_living: "High Cost of Living"
 NOR_high_cost_of_living_desc: "Norway's high standard of living comes with a significant downside: a soaring cost of living that burdens many households. Rising housing prices, expensive goods, and high taxes strain disposable incomes, particularly for younger generations and low-income families. While the nation's welfare system provides a safety net, growing inequality and regional disparities have made affordability a pressing issue in need of systemic solutions."

 NOR_the_modern_welfare_state_idea: "The Modern Welfare State"

Offering universal healthcare, free education, and robust social security, it ensures a high quality of life for its citizens. However, the sustainability of this model faces challenges in the 21st century, including an aging population, rising costs, and economic dependence on finite resources. Balancing social equity with fiscal responsibility will define the future of this system."
