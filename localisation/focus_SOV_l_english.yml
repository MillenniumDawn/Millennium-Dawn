 ###Events
 russia.1.t:0 "The Kursk Submarine Disaster"
 russia.1.d:0 "The Kursk Submarine Disaster was a naval incident 75 kilometers north of the Kola Peninsula, Russia. \n\nThe Russian Oscar-class submarine K-141 'Kursk' suffered a faulty weld on a 65-76 practice torpedo, which caused a peroxide explosion and the subsequent detonation of at least 5 torpedo warheads. \n\nThe Russian Naval Command greatly underestimated the situation and declined international help on the basis of crude allegations that NATO might be involved with the sinking. Although many of the crew members survived the initial explosions, which were even registered by seismographs in the US state Alaska, and were trapped under the sea, the slow and ineffective Russian response ultimately led to the death of all 118 sailors."
 russia.1.o1:0 "Horrible!"
 russia.2.t:0 "Russia offers Union State"
 russia.2.d:0 "Our friends in Russia have offered to draw closer in regards to our already pre-existing Union State and to make it a State Union. Sure, it would give up Belarussian independence, but that is but a small price to pay, right?"
 russia.2.o1:0 "The Union it is!"
 russia.2.o2:0 "Resist and bite!"
 russia.3.t:0 "Belarus accepts!"
 russia.3.d:0 "Belarus has accepted the Union State proposal. They will now follow our orders. Our other allies are however unlikely to approve."
 russia.3.o1:0 "Excellent."
 russia.4.t:0 "Belarus resists us!"
 russia.4.d:0 "Belarus has had the audacity to resist Russian wishes for a Union State! We have to prepare an answer."
 russia.4.o1:0 "Fools."
 russia.5.t:0 "Russian Imperialism threatens our Sovereignty!"
 russia.5.d:0 "Russia has united with Belarus, basically rendering the government in Minsk meaningless. This shows without a doubt that Russia is willing to put its own neo-Soviet imperialistic demands over the good of its allies! How shall we respond?"
 russia.5.o1:0 "We have to break our ties."
 russia.5.o2:0 "We have to hope for the best..."
 russia.6.t:0 "Russian Southern Protection Program"
 russia.6.d:0 "Russia has announced that it would stand with us in military conflict and has sent us military advisors to help or defense against our adversaries."
 russia.6.o1:0 "Excellent."
 russia.7.t:0 "The Invasion of Crimea"
 russia.7.d:0 "While ethnic Russians always were not the happiest of our population groups, this does not explain the unmarked and heavily armed militias invading the peninsula from the east and pushing out our troops. It is now very clear that these separatists are backed, armed and commanded by the Russians, who are massing on our borders. We have to find a response."
 russia.7.o1:0 "We will back down."
 russia.7.o2:0 "We shall stand and fight!"
 russia.8.t:0 "Ukraine backs down!"
 russia.8.d:0 "The Ukrainian government is forced to retreat! Crimea is ours!"
 russia.8.o1:0 "Excellent."
 russia.9.t:0 "Ukraine meets our challenge!"
 russia.9.d:0 "Against all expectations, Ukraine will fight over Crimea, and in response our commanders have already given the orders to advance. We have started something that we will not be able to stop that easily."
 russia.9.o1:0 "Let's do this."
 russia.10.t:0 "Novorossiya"
 russia.10.d:0 "The eastern provinces of Ukraine rise against us in rebellion! The Russian population groups have called us oppressors and slave herders and have called our friendly relations with the west unacceptable. War is inevitable this time!"
 russia.10.o1:0 "We will send them straight to hell."
 russia_news.1.t:0 "Vladimir Putin elected President"
 russia_news.1.d:0 "As was completely predictable, the young political upstart Vladimir Putin, acting president since December 31st, 1999, has been confirmed in his office as President of Russia by popular vote.\n\nPutin was internationally perceived as little more than a puppet who got to power simply because he was Boris Yeltsin's designated political successor, but his recent unforgiving policy on the Chechen insurgency has already proved him to be a more resolute leader than some of his sceptics may expect."
 russia_news.1.o1:0 "Let's see how he does."
 russia_news.2.t:0 "Vladimir Zhirinovsky elected President"
 russia_news.2.d:0 "Even though most observers expected Boris Yeltsin's heir Vladimir Putin to win, it seems as if the Russian population has chosen the hyper-nationalistic Liberal Democratic Party and their leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, to fill the position of Russian President."
 russia_news.2.o1:0 "Putin's career is at an end."
 russia_news.3.t:0 "Gennady Zyuganov elected President"
 russia_news.3.d:0 "In an unexpected turn of events, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has seen its leader, Gennady Zyuganov, elected to the presidency. This comes as an absolute shock, as the presidency was already considered pre-determined and won by Vladimir Putin, the designated heir of Boris Yeltsin. It appears Russian elections are less (or far more) rigged than expected."
 russia_news.3.o1:0 "Does that mark the rebirth of the USSR?"
 russia_news.4.t:0 "Grigory Yavlinsky elected President"
 russia_news.4.d:0 "An internationally almost completely unknown political activist, Grigory Yavlinsky, has won the Russian Presidential Election in what can only be described in a political earthquake. The question of Boris Yeltsin's succession was considered answered before it was even asked, with Vladimir Putin clearly favored among the different candidates. But it appears that the conservative and oligarch-friendly course of Yeltsin's government has not helped Putin's campaign. The Russian people have selected the liberal Yavlinsky instead."
 russia_news.4.o1:0 "Good luck, Grigory!"
 russia_news.4.o2:0 "...who?"
 russia_news.5.t:0 "The Kursk Submarine Disaster"
 russia_news.5.d:0 "The officials of the Russian Federation have recently reported that the Russian Navy submarine K-141, designated name 'Kursk', has sunk in the Barents Sea, 75 kilometers from the shoreline of the Kola peninsula, on August 12th, 2000, at roughly 11:30 AM. The Russian Navy has publically offered several explanations, including a collision or an attack by a NATO submarine. The NATO general secretary has already denied these allegations. The death toll stands at 118, which equals the entire crew of K-141."
 russia_news.5.o1:0 "A great tragedy!"
 russia_news.5.o2:0 "Send our condolences to our allies."
 russia_news.5.o3:0 "We hope the Russians will be fine."
 russia_news.5.o4:0 "They got what was coming to them."

 election_SOV.1.d:0 "Boris Yeltsin's long-time rule of Russia has recently ended, with his political protegé Vladimir Putin being made acting president. Especially through his resolute policy regarding Chechnya, the previously unknown Putin generally earned the approval of the Russian public. Now, elections for the office of President are being held, and Putin is looking to have his government confirmed.\n\nThe other candidates include the ultra-nationalist Zhirinovsky, the neo-Soviet communist Zyuganov and the democratic liberal Yavlinsky."
