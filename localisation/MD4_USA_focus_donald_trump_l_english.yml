 donald_trump.500.t:0 "Dealing with ISIS"
 donald_trump.500.d:0 "For years, ISIS has been a terrorist threat not seen ever in history. Their influence is all over the globe, and while their in Iraq and Syria shrinks, their strangleholds in other areas continues. A determined bombing campaign would put an end to the terrorist threat. It would certainly be costly; however, it would lead to the eventual demise of ISIS. Another approach is to simply continue operations normally, still pounding ISIS troops, but with far less costs than the former option. A last option is to fully withdraw from the campaign against ISIS as it has almost been won already. While this would strengthen ISIS, it would allow us to divert resources to other areas. Mr. President, what shall we do?"

 #News Events
 donald_trump_news.0.t:0 "US Suspends War Against ISIS"
 donald_trump_news.0.d:0 "In a surprising White House press release, the Trump Administration has announced the withdrawal of US forces from the fight against ISIS. Donald Trump tweeted upon the matter, calling ISIS a 'dead terrorist group' and that 'US troops will focus on other matters.' Supporters call this move necessary to limit unnecessary expenditure, while the opposition state that this will only make the terrorism situation worse. Experts believe this will embolden ISIS into taking an offensive stance against her neighbors, as she gathers more fighters in Iraq and Sytria. The Administration has made no comment to this critique so far."

Donald Trump replied to the statement by saying 'US bomber crews, of whom are very, very great people, will fly and bomb the hell outta ISIS. Trust me, you will never have seen anything like it ever before.' Experts warn this plan is expensive, but the President is adamant about his plans for ISIS. More details have yet to come."
