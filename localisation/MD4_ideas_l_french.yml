While we, respectfully, think you should adopt all our policies, we realize that, with the election results not being entirely in our favor, we must settle the best possible agreement for our voters, who I might add, dearly yearn for our great conservative principles to be put into action.\n\nIf you accept our cooperation, we sincerely hope that you won't besmudge the good name of [conservatism_L] with foolish and rash policymaking.

Liberty is, after all, the basis upon which any respectable government is built, and of course we would like to take part in the government to promote liberalism. Because, we both know that individual freedom and limited government are the best way for humans to form a free society.\n\nTo make sure your form of liberalism is as unrestrained as ours however, you will need to accede to our completely reasonable and unquestionably mutually beneficial demands before we can commit to a final agreement."

So there is a possibility we could entertain the notion of joining - if you pledge to promote the vital principles of progressivism and social democratic values. As we say in [socialism_L], social democratic values are for everyone, and we insist this holds true for your government.\n\nBy the way, aren't the taxes a bit low?
