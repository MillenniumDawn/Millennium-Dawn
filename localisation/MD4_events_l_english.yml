Keep in mind that predicting the future is difficult and hard work so it may be that our experts are wrong. \nWe would, of course, never dream to give your excellency orders on what to do, but making some adjustments now will be less painful than a full blown crisis in the future."

 econvent.2.t:0 "Collapsing housing prices"
 econvent.2.d:0 "As the prices of houses and appartments have went through the roof, especially in the last year, people have taken out larger and larger loans to afford housing, while speculators have invested heavily in property, also using loaned money. Right now, this is coming to an end, fast. The prices are dropping, and people are trying to sell like there is no tomorrow. Many less fortunates will be stuck with huge loans they can't repay. As people are cursing both [Root.GetLeader] and the [Root.GetAdjective] Central Bank for causing this, we must make an public statement on how we intend to handle this crisis fast."
 econvent.2.a:0 "We will flood the system with cheap money to make the market bounce back"
 econvent.2.b:0 "This is painful, but housing prices had to come down"
 
 econvent.3.t:0 "Stock Market Crash"
 econvent.3.d:0 "It seems the chaos following the bursting of the housing-bubble has reached the Stock Market. The share prices of nearly all listed [Root.GetAdjective] companies tumbled down heavily this morning, and our currency fell a great deal too. Trading was temporarly suspended before lunch, but no improvement is expected once markets re-open tomorrow as everyone is desperate to sell their stocks."

 econvent.4.d:0 "Despite the hot delicious latte-art espresso in your "[Root.GetName] §R<3§! [Root.GetLeader]"-cup, this is not a good day. Desperate financial moguls, their lobbyists, and the politicians they have made contributions to - all are swarming the [Root.GetAdjective] governing officies, and all have the same message: "We need a bailout!". \n \nApparently the dual shock of the Housing Downturn and the Stock Market Crash were too much for the financial sector to handle. The buildup of bad debts from their speculation is simply too great, there needs to be an inflow of fresh government money - or there will be bankrupcies across the board with innocent savers losing their deposits."

 econvent.5.t:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] Consumers Spend Less"
 econvent.5.d:0 "A recent report highlighted that the hard-working [Root.GetAdjective] people are increasingly worried about their future. This pessimism is causing people to save more, and overall consumption is down. If this continues, a lot of businesses in [Root.GetName] will have to downsize or close down. Businesses that mainly exports [Root.GetAdjective] goods are however, not affected by this."

 econvent.6.d:0 "The data is clear; the international exports of [Root.GetName] are going down. The cause, however, is being hotly debated amongst [Root.GetLeader]'s economic advicers. One theory is that we have become less competetive due to our relative high wages, another is that our competitors have increased the quality of their products. Others feel that the decrease in demand is just due to shifting trends abroad. Whatever the cause, there is not really much we can do about this except putting it behind us and working harder in the future."
 econvent.6.a:0 "Foreigners are being silly. [Root.GetAdjective] stuff is the best!"
 
 econvent.7.t:0 "Drought causes disaster for [Root.GetAdjective] farmers"
 econvent.7.d:0 "While we usually don't get much rain, the rainfall this growing season has been absymal, with most crops failing. What little agricultural produce has been produced is entirely due to remaining rivers and artificial irrigation, something that is sadly not very common here in [Root.GetName]. Farmers are demanding aid from the [Root.GetLeader] Government, and city dwellers are getting worried about rising food prices."
 econvent.7.a:0 "Better luck next season"
 
 econvent.8.t:0 "Famine in [Root.GetName]!"

 #Yemen Events

 Yemen.4.t:0 "The War in Yemen has Ended"
 Yemen.4.d:0 "With the country in ruin, the Yemeni Civil War has finally concluded, granting victory to the Hadi-led government, backed by the Saudi Coalition. In the final days of the conflict, coalition forces managed to capture and destroy Houthi and Al-Qaeda ammo dumps, including the infamous Burkan 2-H scud missles. Though many may still hold their loyalties to the Houthis, they have been disarmed, and in the coming days, the remaining Zaydi radicals will be rooted out and dealt with. Democracy has prevailed in the region, and the country of Yemen is on it's way to being restored."
 Yemen.4.d2:0 "With the Hadi-led government reduced to rubble, the Houthi cause has found itself at the forefront of Yemen's future leadership. As was their goal, the Houthi's have managed to drive salafism and devotion to western ideologies from the region, and those who fought for it, as the Al-Qaeda and coalition forces lie in ruin. Now with the full responsibilty of leading Yemen into the future, the Houthi government has begun the process of transforming from it's interrim state, and they have now embarked on the path of restoring the country."
 Yemen.4.d3:0 "After years of fighting between the Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels, the most unlikely of all victors has emerged from the conflict. The remnants of Al-Qaeda in Yemen have found themselves as the architect of a new caliphate in the region, and have undergone a transformation for the future that will put all infidels in the region in danger. The jihadis have prevailed, and they have made it clear that this is only the beginning, and the rest of the world will soon realise what this new caliphate can do."
 Yemen.4.a:0 "Victory is finally ours..."
 Yemen.4.b:0 "But at what cost?"
 Yemen.4.c:0 "It could have been worse..."
 Yemen.4.e:0 "Interesting."
 
 Saleh.1.t:0 "The Houthi Power Struggle"
 Saleh.1.d:0 "The unlikely alliance between the Houthi rebels and Ali Abdullah Saleh's General People's Congress, has been on shaky ground since the day it was concieved. With help from our coalition members operating inside Yemen, we've discovered that former President Saleh has a growing discontent for the Houthi leadership, and rightly so. The Houthis oppose being effectively controlled by foreign powers, and seek to restore Yemen as it's own, completely independent entity free of salafism and western ideals. Saleh on the other hand, wants to restore Yemen as a free, united and democratic country, eager to participate in foreign affairs to an extent, though he does have his reasons to resent a number of western nations. This relationship is bound to boil over into a future conflict between the two parties, and it may be what the coalition needs."
 Saleh.1.a:0 "We don't have time for this..."
 Saleh.1.b:0 "Get President Saleh on the phone..." 
 
 Saleh.2.t:0 "Saleh Suggests Coalition Dialogue"
 Saleh.2.d:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh, the head of the General People's Congress aligned with the Houthi cause, is suggesting that the GPC and Houthi leadership open up talks with the Saudi-led coalition currently operating alongside President Hadi's Yemen. Though we very narrowly consider him an ally, it appears he has had a change of heart, and not in a good way. He now sternly suggests that the Houthi leadership come to a decision on whether or not this brutal civil war should continue. The likelihood of us coming out of these talks with something to gain is very small, and it could all very well be a ploy to remove us from power."
 Saleh.2.a:0 "Absolutely not!"
 Saleh.2.b:0 "It couldn't hurt..."
 
 Saleh.3.t:0 "Houthi Leaders are Willing to Talk"
 Saleh.3.d:0 "After pressure from the former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, the leaders of the Houthi insurgents in Sana'a are willing to try to come to terms with Hadi and our coalition."
 Saleh.3.a:0 "Well then, let's do this."
 Saleh.3.b:0 "This probably isn't a good idea..."
 
 Saleh.5.t:0 "Saleh Embarks on a Dangerous Path"
 Saleh.5.d:0 "After years of an indecisive and unstable alliance between Houthi and Republican forces, former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, held a speech directed at the Saudi-led coalition highlighting the so-called stupidity of the Houthi cause. Saleh stated that if the coalition were to lift their blockade and open the airports to ease the humanitarian effort, him and his republican forces were willing to pledge their allegiance to Saudi Arabia, declaring himself an enemy of our alliance. Saleh appeared fully committed in his most recent speech, and publically declared a new chapter in Yemen's history amidst this humanitarian crisis, as a united, free and democratic Yemen. The words of Saleh - I am going to fight the enemies of humanity and the enemies of our homeland who are trying hard to erase its identity and destroy its gains and humiliate the Yemenis!"
 Saleh.5.a:0 "Find this traitor..."
 Saleh.5.b:0 "He doesn't have the guts to do it..."
 
 Saleh.6.t:0 "Saleh is On The Run"
 Saleh.6.d:0 "After giving a series of treacherous speeches, Ali Abdullah Saleh has made it clear he no longer wishes to work alongside the Houthis. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi knew of Saleh's approaching treachery, and he issued several warnings to him, all of which were not heeded. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi declared this as a treasonous act, which subsequently led to Saleh's home in Sana'a being destroyed by Houthi mortar fire, and he is now fleeing the country. Houthi fighters have been hot on his trail, and they've managed to drive him into a potentially fatal trap south of Sana'a, where combat between the Houthi's and the coalition still rages. A number of fighters manning the front are prepared to pull back and intervene on your command."
 Saleh.6.a:0 "Pull the trigger..."
 Saleh.6.b:0 "Let him go..."
 
 Saleh.7.t:0 "The Supreme Political Council"
 Saleh.7.d:0 "With the war won, the time has come to rebuild our country that we fought so desperately to free from it's misguided leadership. Our associates from the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, an interim government that we had put in place amidst the civil war, remind us of their contribution to the war effort and urge us to carry out our original plan of dividing our presidential council equally between both parties. Let us remember that a number of these men were among those we started this fight against, and those we could not maintain a stable alliance with. We cannot forsee the future, but allowing them a seat in our parliament may very well lead us back into the uncertainty we sought to destroy."
 Saleh.7.a:0 "We fought to achieve this position, and we will fight to defend it"
 Saleh.7.b:0 "Nonsense, we will rebuild our nation together"
 
 Saleh.8.t:0 "Houthi Leadership Denies Saleh's Suggestion"
 Saleh.8.d:0 "After our talk with former Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, he made an effort to convince the Houthi leadership to come to a conclusion on whether or not this war of theirs should continue. As we expected, he was rejected without a second thought. The Houthis appear to be beyond adamant on the topic of continuing their war effort to overthrow the democratic government of Yemen. This has worn on on the alliance between Saleh's General People's Congress and the Houthi rebels, and if we push Saleh harder, he may be willing to finally severe ties with the misguided cause."
 Saleh.8.a:0 "We must try harder!"
 Saleh.8.b:0 "Forget it..."
 
 Saleh.9.t:0 "Saleh Persists"
 Saleh.9.d:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh once again, suggests that we open up talks with the Saudi-led coalition, who I must remind you, is our enemy. It is true that our alliance with the GPC has always been in a critical state, but this persistence by Saleh has not appeared out of thin air, he must have a motive. It would not be crazy to believe that the Saudi-led coalition is in contact with him, we must watch this closely."
 Saleh.9.a:0 "This might actually be a good idea..."
 Saleh.9.b:0 "Ali, stop this immediately, or else"
 Saleh.9.c:0 "Mr. Saleh, may I have a word with you?"
 
 HOU_Saleh.1:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh will be pursued by Houthi fighters."
 HOU_Saleh.2:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh will be contacted about bringing the Yemeni Civil War to an end, with our help. Whether that be through diplomacy or brute force, we must convince him to attend a dialogue with our coalition."
 HOU_Saleh.3:0 "Our alliance has never been as strong as would be ideal, but I do value our allegiance, though it may not seem this way. I understand that you want a conclusion to this war, but unfortunately I cannot allow myself or my comrades to deal with this devil of a coalition. Surely you understand?"
 
 Saleh.10.t:0 "Saleh is Wasting Our Time..."
 Saleh.10.d:0 "Once again, the leader of the General People's Congress aligned with the Houthi rebels,  Ali Abdullah Saleh, was denied by the Houthi leadership to commence peace talks with our coalition. It has been clear from the beginning that the Houthi leadership will not speak with us, as they see us as a sworn enemy. With the GPC-Houthi alliance as critical as it is, we must deliver Ali Abdullah Saleh an ultimatum immediately. Without him, the Houthis governing parties will be in shambles without proper skill and talent behind it. With him, the leadership has competence, though it lacks a certain ability when it comes to progress, but it could potentially carry the Houthis to victory."
 Saleh.10.a:0 "He either takes action, or we cannot guarantee his safety."
 Saleh.10.b:0 "This is pointless..."
 
 Saleh.11.t:0 "The General People's Congress Defects!"
 Saleh.11.d:0 "Even after numerous occasions in which Saleh's Republican forces have exchanged fire with ours, we've formally remained allies. No longer, these traitors have officially declared themselves as our enemy after their treasonous leader, Ali Abdullah Saleh, was rightfully disposed of. The GPC and it's troops are actively engaging in firefights with us in the streets of our cities, we must put a stop to this at once."
 Saleh.11.a:0 "Traitors! I should have seen this coming!"
 
 Saleh.12.t:0 "Former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh Assassinated!"
 Saleh.12.d:0 "This day is considered a major victory for the Houthi cause, as the man who sought to tear them apart from the inside, has now been defeated. It was long believed by the Houthis that Saleh had been in contact with the Saudi-led coalition, but it wasn't until recently that Mr. Saleh had shown his true colors to the Houthis, and attempted to side with the coalition by declaring a new chapter of unification and democracy in Yemen. This struck a great ire in the Houthis, and with Saleh gone, they claim that their morale is soaring."
