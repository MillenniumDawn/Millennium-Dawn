 BOL_ethnic_divide_decisions_desc: "\n\n\n\n\n\n£BOL_desctext_ethnic_divide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolivia is suffering from deep ethnic and racial divisions, between the Mestizo people, which are people of mixed European and Indigenous descent which mostly make up the majority in Eastern Bolivia, collectively known as the Media Luna and the Indigenous People of Bolivia which make up the majority in Western Bolivia. In recent years tensions have flared up, with many indigenous protests over issue like lack of rights and water access. It is important to keep the opinion of these groups at stable levels, otherwise we may get two different kinds of instability from both sides, Therefore we must tread carefully as one bad decision can lead to the fracturing of Bolivia as we know it.\n\n§RIf Indigenous Opinion falls below 15, Indigenous groups will demand the resignation of our government by means of mass protest, and if we do not comply to their demands the Indigenous People of Western Bolivia will revolt against the government.§!\n\n§YIf Mestizo opinion falls under 15, the historically influential and pro-mestizo [Nat_Autocracy_L] will demand the resignation of our government and the placement of a pro-mestizo interim government until early elections are held, but if we do not comply the Military will launch a coup and install a military regime in power.§!\n\nMestizo Opinion: [?BOL_mestizo_support]\n\nIndigenous Opinion: [?BOL_indigenous_support]"
