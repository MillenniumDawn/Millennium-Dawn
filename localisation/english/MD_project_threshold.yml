 project_threshold.1.t: "The Zenobia and Saladin Lines are Under Construction"
 project_threshold.1.d: "In response to the growing threat emerging from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle Eastern Alliance has authorized the rapid construction of a fortified defense line along the southern Nile and western desert sectors of Egypt. Designated the Zenobia Line, this position will anchor heavy artillery emplacements, trench systems across key approach vectors.\n\nShould the Zenobia line fall, the Saladin line stands strong behind it. Spanning the entire canal zone from Port Said to the Red Sea, this fortification will act as the absolute defense line.\n"
