 # Counter Terror Operations
 IS_counter_terror_threat_text: "Terror Threat"
 terror_main_category: "The higher the §YTerror Threat§! of a country is, the higher the likelihood of jihadist groups launching attacks on domestic targets (such as government offices) and foreign targets (like military bases) in that country. Attacks may be launched in a neighboring country if its border is left unguarded. The severity of terror attacks and the likelihood of them succeeding can be decreased by raising internal security spending and conducting counter-terrorism training."
 terror_instruct_category: "The ability of a country to decrease its §YTerror Threat§! beyond a certain point depends on whether it is at war, its stability, GDP/c and level of corruption. §YTerror Threat§! can increase due to the level of §YRadicalization§! and infiltration by jihadists from neighboring countries. It will decrease at low levels of §YRadicalization§! and as a result of raids and external intervention. The minimum level of §YRadicalization§! can be decreased by fighting corruption, increasing stability and growing the economy. §YRadicalization§! increases along with the popularity of [Caliphate_L] and as a result of rapid social liberalization."
