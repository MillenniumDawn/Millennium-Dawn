 SyriaDecisions.14.desc:0 "A video has started circulating on the internet of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, being on a drunken rampage. The video also includes clips of him doing various sexual activities with what seem to be prostitutes. Nasrallah has obviously denied the legitimacy of the video, claiming it's 'nothing more than a Zionist plot'. However, the Shura Council has decided to revoke his position and nominate [Root.GetLeader] as the new general secretary.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has long campaigned for more independence from Iran."
