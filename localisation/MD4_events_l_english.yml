Keep in mind that predicting the future is difficult and hard work so it may be that our experts are wrong. \nWe would, of course, never dream to give your excellency orders on what to do, but making some adjustments now will be less painful than a full blown crisis in the future."

 econvent.2.d:0 "As the prices of houses and appartments have went through the roof, especially in the last year, people have taken out larger and larger loans to afford housing, while speculators have invested heavily in property, also using loaned money. Right now, this is coming to an end, fast. The prices are dropping, and people are trying to sell like there is no tomorrow. Many less fortunates will be stuck with huge loans they can't repay. As people are cursing both [Root.GetLeader] and the [Root.GetAdjective] Central Bank for causing this, we must make an public statement on how we intend to handle this crisis fast."

 econvent.3.t:0 "Stock Market Crash"
 econvent.3.d:0 "It seems the chaos following the bursting of the housing-bubble has reached the Stock Market. The share prices of nearly all listed [Root.GetAdjective] companies tumbled down heavily this morning, and our currency fell a great deal too. Trading was temporarly suspended before lunch, but no improvement is expected once markets re-open tomorrow as everyone is desperate to sell their stocks."

Desperate financial moguls, their lobbyists, and the politicians they have made contributions to - all are swarming the [Root.GetAdjective] governing officies, and all have the same message: "We need a bailout!". \n \nApparently the dual shock of the Housing Downturn and the Stock Market Crash were too much for the financial sector to handle. The buildup of bad debts from their speculation is simply too great, there needs to be an inflow of fresh government money - or there will be bankrupcies across the board with innocent savers losing their deposits."

This pessimism is causing people to save more, and overall consumption is down. If this continues, a lot of businesses in [Root.GetName] will have to downsize or close down. Businesses that mainly exports [Root.GetAdjective] goods are however, not affected by this."

One theory is that we have become less competetive due to our relative high wages, another is that our competitors have increased the quality of their products. Others feel that the decrease in demand is just due to shifting trends abroad. Whatever the cause, there is not really much we can do about this except putting it behind us and working harder in the future."
